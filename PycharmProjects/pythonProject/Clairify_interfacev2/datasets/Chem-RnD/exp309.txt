1,2,4-Trimethoxy-3-methyl-anthraquinone (1.047 g, 3.4 mmol) was magnetically stirred in pyridine (3 cm3) and water (7 cm3) at 85 °C. KMnO4 (1.5 g, 9.5 mmol) was added over 0.5 h. Heating was continued for 6 h the mixture was allowed to stand 2 d at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with water (10 cm3) and diethyl ether – hexane (3:2, 50 cm3) and the solution filtered. The residue was washed with 10% aqueous pyridine (2 x 10 cm3) and the phases separated. The aqueous phase was acidified with H2SO4 to give yellow needles (269 mg, 23%) of the carboxylic acid.
Evaporation of the diethyl ether – hexane phase gave the starting material (561 mg, 54%).
