A mixture of alkyne (7.62g, 19.08mmol) and zinc (II) chloride (2.6g, 19.08mmol) in trimethylorthoformate (138ml, 1.26mol) in a Dean-Stark apparatus was heated at 160Â°C for 6hrs.  The reaction mixture was then filtered through celite washing with ether.  The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and purified by flash column chromatography on silica eluting with 10:1 petrol/ether to yield the title compound as a yellow oil (5.6g, 92%)
