To a 100ml round bottom three neck flask, equipped with heating mantle, mechanical stirrer, water condenser and  nitrogen inlet was charged 32ml of 200 proof ethanol, 8 ml of deionized water and 0.512g (1.55 mmol) of  methyl- (p-trans-heptylcyclohexyl)carbamate. The mixture was stirred until homogeneous. 10g of potassium hydroxide pellets were then added and the mixture stirred until all of the pellets has dissolved. The solution was refluxed under nitrogen for 24 hours and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 100ml round bottom flask and the ethanol removed on a rotory evaporator (water bath, bath temperature ~ 60⁰, water aspirator pressure). The aqueous residue was cooled to room temperature, transferred to a 100 ml separatory funnel, and extracted three times with 10ml ether portions. The combined ether extracts were dried for 2 hours over 2g anhydrous sodium sulfate and  the ether solution decanted off to a 100 ml round bottom flask. The sodium sulfate residue was shaken with 10 additional ml of ether which was decanted and  combined with the earlier extracts. The ether was removed on  a rotory evaporator (water bath, bath temperature ~ 60⁰), yielding 0.348g (88%) of essentially pure amine, which solidified on standing at room temperature. The material may be further purified by distillation on a short path Kugelrohr apparatus (0.1mm, pressure, oil bath temperature ~140⁰ ) to yield an analytically pure sample.
