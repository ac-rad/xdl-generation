A solution of  POCl3 (1.00 mmol, 0.093 mL) in CHCl3 (3.5 mL) was added dropwise to a mixture of N-allyl-N-(2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)-3-nitropropanamide (0.670 mmol, 250 mg) and Et3N (2.68 mmol, 0.373 mL) in CHCl3 (3.5 mL). After 30 min Et3N (1.33 mmol, 0.186 mL) POCl3 (0.499 mmol, 0.0465 mL) in CHCl3 (1.5 mL) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere at which point water (20 mL) was added. The crude product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 15 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After evaporation of the organic solvent, the crude product was purified by flash chromatography using silica gel (eluent: ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1) to obtain title compound as a white solid (168 mg, 71% yield,  mp 192-194 °C, Rf= 0.20   (ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1). 50:50 Mixture of diastereoisomers as determined by 1H-NMR integration.
