To a solution of sodium hydroxide (14 g; 0.33 mol) in water (40 cm3) was added benzaldehyde ( 21 g; 0.2 mol), followed by hydroxylamine hydrochloride (15 g; 0.22 mol) portionwise, with vigourous stirring.  On cooling, and leaving to stand overnight, a crystalline mass formed.  Water was added until this dissolved (about 150 cm3) and CO2 gas was passed through.  This was simply achieved by attaching a conical flask of solid CO2 to a bubbler via the solution.  The mixture went white, and an oil formed.
The mixture was extracted with ether (4 x 75 cm3), dried and concentrated, and distilled under reduced pressure.  Product obtained as a colourless liquid; reported to be a solid, mp 35 Â°C.  Obtained exclusively as syn-isomer (see Pejkovic-Tadic et al. Helv. Chim. Acta, 1965, 48, 1157.) Yield 20.17 g; 93%
