4-Hydroxyphenylboronic acid (100 mg, 1 mmol) and sodium azide (94 mg, 2 mmol) were stirred in water: ACN (1:1, 10 mL) for 10 min. 10 mol% of copper sulphate (10 mg) was then added and reaction mixture was stirred for another 30 min. The in-situ formation of aryl azide was monitored by TLC (by observing the disappearance of 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid spot on TLC, mobile phase: EtOAc: hexane - 1:1). The phenylacetylene (0.81 mg, 1.1 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2.5 h. The completion of reaction was monitored by TLC (mobile phase: EtOAc: hexane - 1:1). The reaction mixture was filtered through filter paper and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate (25 mL). The filtrate was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by silica gel (mesh 100-200) column chromatography using EtOAc: hexane (EtOAc- Heane - 1: 1) as eluting solvent to get titled product in 98% yield.
