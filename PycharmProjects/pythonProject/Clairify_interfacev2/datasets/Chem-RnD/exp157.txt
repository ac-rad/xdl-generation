Copper(I)bromide (12.9 mg, 0.09 mmol) was added to solution of N-Benzyl-2-bromo-N-(3,4-dihydro-naphthalen-1-yl)-2-methyl-propionamide(115 mg, 0.3 mmol) and Me6-TREN (20.7 mg, 0.09 mmol) in dichloromethane (2.5 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes under N2. The resulting solution was filtered through a small silica plug with ethyl acetate to remove the copper residues. The filtrate was then reduced to dryness in vacuo and purified by flash chromatography, petroleum ether : ethyl acetate (9:1), to give the observed cyclic product (90 mg, 99%).
