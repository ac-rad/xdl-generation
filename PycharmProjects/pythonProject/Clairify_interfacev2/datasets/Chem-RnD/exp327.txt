A solution of benzaldehyde (1.70 mmol, 0.172 mL), propargylamine (1.70 mmol, 0.11 mL), cyclohexyl isocyanide (1.70 mmol, 0.211 mL) and 3-nitropropionic acid (1.70 mmol, 0.202 g) in 10 mL MeOH was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. After 28 h the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to leave a yellow solid. The residue was washed with cold Et2O (3x20 mL) to give pure title compound as pale yellow solid (480 mg, 76% yield, mp 179-180 Â°C, Rf= 0.52 (ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1). 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed title compound is a mixture of two rotamers in an approximately 1:3.5 ratio.
