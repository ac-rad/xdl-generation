These compounds were easily prepared in essentially quantitative yield by reduction of the previously described (lead reference) amides with lithium aluminum hydride in dry ether. A representative synthesis follows.
To a 50ml round bottom three neck flask, equipped with magnetic stirrer, water condenser, calcium chloride drying tube on top of the condenser, and nitrogen inlet was charged with 25ml ether and 0.127 g (0.4 mmol) of N-[(4-trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)phenyl]butanamide. The mixture was stirred until homogeneous. Lithium aluminum hydride (1.0 g, 26 mmol) was added and the mixture further stirred under nitrogen for 12 hours (overnight). Water was then slowly added dropwise to the solution via a 10 ml pressure equalized dropping funnel until and a copious white precipitate separated with mild exotherm. The solution was then cooled to room temperature with an ice bath. The precipitate was suction filtered, washed with an additional 5 ml of ether, and the combined filtrate dried over 2 g anhydrous sodium sulfate for 2 hours. The dried ether solution was decanted to a 25 ml beaker, and the sulfate washed with an additional 2-3 ml ether which was combined with the ether solution. A boiling stone was added and the ether removed on a steam bath or warm water bath giving an essentially quantitative yield of N-butyl-4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)aniline, a nematic liquid crystal.
An analytically pure material was obtained by distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus at reduced pressure under pump vacuum.Â  The material slowly solidified on standing at room temperature.
