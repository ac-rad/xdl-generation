(R)-2-Phenylglycine methyl ester hydrochloride (4.03 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (40 ml) under argon. Dry TEA (8.4 ml, 60 mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was filtered into a solution of pyridine-2,6-dicarbonyl chloride (2.04 g, 10 mmol) in dry DCM (40 ml). The reaction was stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was washed with water (3 Ã— 40 ml) and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure to obtain yellow oil. Recrystallisation from DCM/pentane yielded white crystalline solid. Yield 2.3 g (49%).
