To a stirred solution of the substrate (497 mg, 1.2 mmoles) in methanol (20 ml) and water (5 ml) was added potassium carbonate (835 mg, 6 mmoles) and the mixture heated at reflux for 4 hours. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and the solvent removed in vacuo and then dissoled in dichloromethane (25 ml) and washed with water. The aqueous layer was re-extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 20 ml) and the organic layers combined, dried and evaporated. The crude product was purified by silica-gel chromatography (petrol:ether 2:1) to give the product as a white solid (150 mg, 32%).
