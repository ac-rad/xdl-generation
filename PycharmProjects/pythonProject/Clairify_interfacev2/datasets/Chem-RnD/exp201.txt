5-Chloro-10-oxa-3-thia-tricyclo[5,2,1,0*1,5*]dec-8-ene- 3,3-dioxide: 
To a solution of m-CPBA (200 mg, 0.8 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL), cooled to 0 Â°C, was added dropwise a solution of 5-chloro-10-oxa-3-thia-tricyclo [5.2.1.01, 5] dec-8-ene (150 mg, 0.8 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) over 3 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and then diluted with cold 4 % sodium bicarbonate solution (4 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with water (20 mL) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue   was purified by silica gel column chromatography using EtOAc / n-Hexane (3:7) as eluent to provide pure dioxide. Off white crystals (1:1 Ether / DCM): yield     140 mg (80%).
