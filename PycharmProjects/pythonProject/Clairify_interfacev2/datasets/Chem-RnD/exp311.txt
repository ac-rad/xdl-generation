2-Bromomethyl-1,3,4-trimethoxyanthraquinone (4.929 g, 12.6 mmol) was stirred in dimethyl sulfoxide and NaNO2 (3.8 g, 55 mmol) added. The bromo compound dissolved after a few seconds. After standing overnight, acetic acid (7.2 g, 12 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred at 35 °C for 6 h. HCl (10 cm3, 5M) was added and stirring continued for 1 h. The product was diluted with diethyl ether (100 cm3) and HCl (100 cm3, 1M). The phases were separated and the aqueous phase extracted again with ether (3 x 100 cm3). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated NaCl solution (50 cm3) then extracted with portions of NaOH solution (1M, a total of 200 cm3). The aqueous extract was acidified (conc. HCl, 20 cm3) and allowed to stand overnight at 5 °C to give orange-brown needles of 1,3,4-trimethoxy-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydro-anthracene-2-carboxylic acid (2.13 g, 62% yield).
 
The ether solution of NaOH-insolubles was evaporated to give a yellow solid (1.80 g) which was extracted with boiling cyclohexane (200 cm3) to give yellow needles of 2-hydroxymethyl-1,3,4-trimethoxyanthraquinone (1.39 g, 34% yield).
