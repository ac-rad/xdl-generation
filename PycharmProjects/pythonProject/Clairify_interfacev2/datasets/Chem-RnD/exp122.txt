WARNING: Peresters are potentially explosive, especially when dry.  Take special care, and perform the reaction behind a screen.  When transferring crystals, treat gently and avoid scratching.

Oxalyl chloride (0.64 g) in pentane (5 cm3) was added over a period of 5 minutes to a stirred solution of pyridine (0.80 g) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.90 g) at -5 °C.  The solution was allowed to warm slowly to about 15 °C, and the pyridinium chloride that precipitated was filtered and washed with pentane. The combined filtrates were allowed to stand in a dry ice/acetone bath until the perester precipitated as white needles, which were filtered (0.70 g; 69%) and stored in the freezer.
