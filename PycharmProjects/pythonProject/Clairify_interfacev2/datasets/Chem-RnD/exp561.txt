A solution of 4-hydroxybenzaldhyde (3.03 g, 25 mmol), propargyl bromide (11.61g, 98 mmol), and potassium carbonate (13.55 g, 98 mmol) in acetone (250 mL) was heated at reflux for 4 h with constant stirring.  Upon cooling, the reaction mixture was transferred to a separating funnel along with distilled water (50 mL) and DCM (30 mL).  The product was extracted into the organic layer, isolated and dried over sodium sulphate.  The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield 4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzaldehyde (3.26 g, 82 %) as a pale orange solid.
