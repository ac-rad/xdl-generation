2,3,5-pyrazinetricarboxylic acid dihydrate (5.00 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in 200 ml of distilled water and heated to 110 ºC for 72 h. The straw yellow solution was left to cool and stand at ambient temperature for 12 h. The resulting suspension of the precipitated 2,5-isomer (brown powder) and some of the crystallised 2,6-isomer (colourless needles) was filtered and the solids washed with hot distilled water (50 ml) to redissolve any of the 2,6-isomer.
The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure (ca. 75 ml) and a first crop of product crystallised as large colourless needles, the crystals were isolated by filtration and the filtrate concentrated further (ca. 20 ml) to yield a second crop of crystals. The combined crops (2.09 g, 51 %) were dried in a vacuum desiccators and the filtrate stored at +4ºC for 12 h to yield a third crop (0.82 g, 20 %).
Total yield: (2.92 g, 71%)
