Magnesium metal (0.61g, 25.0mmol) was activated by heating (heat gun) for 5 min with a crystal of I2 in dry THF (40cm3) under an Ar atmosphere. To this rapidly stirred suspension was added 4-bromobut-1-ene (2.54cm3, 25.0 mmol) dropwise via syringe. After the initial exotherm had subsided the reaction mixture was stirred for a further 1 h after which HMPA (9cm3) was added and the mixture cooled to -78°C. Anhydrous copper (I) iodide (0.39g, 2.05mmol) was added in one portion and the resulting slurry stirred for a further 10min. To this was added a mixture of 2-cyclohexenone (2.0g, 20.8mmol) and TMSCl (6.2cm3, 48.85 mmol) in 20cm3 dry THF dropwise over 10min. The resulting white suspension was stirred for 1h at -78°C, before the addition of Et3N (5cm3) and allowing to warm to RT. The resulting suspension was poured onto pet. ether (250cm3), washed with water (3 x 200cm3), dried over MgSO4 and the solvent evaporated to give a clear yellow oil. Kugelrohr distillation (130-140° @ 20mmHg) gave the pure product as a clear liquid (4.1g,88%).
