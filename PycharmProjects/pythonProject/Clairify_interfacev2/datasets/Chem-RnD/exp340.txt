A mixture of 3-oxo-N-[4-[4-(3-oxobutanoylamino)phenyl]ethylphenyl]butanamide (300 mg, 0.789 mmol), thiourea (183 mg, 2.41 mmol), benzaldehyde (0.24 mL, 2.41 mmol) and catalytic amount of conc. HCl (4 drops) in EtOH (10 mL) was refluxed overnight. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool. The solid product formed was filtered, washed with water (5 mL) and cold ether (3x5 mL) to remove the unreacted thiourea or benzaldehyde or 3-oxo-N-[4-[4-(3-oxobutanoylamino)phenyl]ethylphenyl]butanamide and dried. The title compound was obtained as a cream coloured solid (450 mg, 88% yield).
