Cycloaddition Reaction of N-(2-bromoally)-N-(tertbutoxycarbonyl)-5-methylfurfurylamine:
The amines (5 mmol) was heated up to 110 Â°C in 10 mL of toluene for 4 days at which time the reaction mixture was cooled and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography afforded the cycloadducts, and in all cases, the polarity of the cycloadduct was greater that its precursor.
