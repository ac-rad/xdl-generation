A solution of isopropyl amine (4.9 g, 83 mmol) in DCM (20 ml) was added to a stirred and cooled (0°C) solution of acrylic acid (5 g, 69 mmol) in DCM (30 ml) and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. To the resulting reaction mixture HOBt (3.75 g, 28 mmol) and NMM (N-methyl morpholine) (8.4 g, 83 mmol) were added. After 30 min., EDC (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide) (15.9 g, 83 mmol) was added to reaction mixture and stirred for 3 h at 0°C and then at rt for 4h. The mixture was diluted with water; organic layer was extracted and concentrated in vacuum. Crude product was chromatographed on a silica gel (100-200 mesh size) column using MeOH/DCM (2:98) as eluent to provide the product as buff white solid. The product was further crystallized in hexane. Needle shaped white crystals of the title compound (4.2 g, 54 %) were obtained.
