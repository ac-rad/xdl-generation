To a stirred solution of methyl 2,2-dimethoxypropanoate (10.89 g, 73.5 mmol), methyl acetate (10.8 mL, 136.0 mmol) and anhydrous methanol (0.1 mL) was added sodium pieces (< 5 mm, 2.1 g, 90.5 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 16 h (orange solution). More methyl acetate (10.8 mL, 136.0 mmol) and sodium sodium pieces (< 5 mm, 2.1 g, 90.5 mmol) were added and stirring continued for a further 8 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool, ice added (40 g), acidified with hydrochloric acid 12 M (final pH of 6) and was extracted with diethyl ether (4 x 60 mL). The combined organic phase was dried (MgSO4), evaporated under vacumm and distilled (62-66 °C/0.3 mmHg) giving methyl 4,4-dimethoxy-3-oxopentanoate (7.98 g, 57 %) as a clear liquid. 
The above methyl ester (6.41 g, 33.7 mmol) was added to a stirred cold (ice bath) solution of anhydrous dichloromethane (20 mL) under an argon atmosphere, followed by the dropwise addition (2 h) of a solution of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (3.4 mL, 33.7 mmol) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (2.83 mL, 33.7 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (14 mL) and stirring was continued for a further 1h. Aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (20 mL), was added followed by extration with dichloromethane (3 x 30 mL). The combined organic phases were dried (MgSO4), evaporated under vacuum and purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, eluent: petroleum ether 40/60 : ethyl acetate from 1:0 to 6:4) to give the title compound (5.57 g, 75 %), as colorless liquid, Rf = 0.50 (CHCl3).
