A 0.5 L three-neck round bottomed flask, fitted with a septum, an argon inlet/outlet and a stirring bar was charged with freshly cut fine pieces of lithium metal (from a 5 mm diameter Li-wire, 2.56 g, 366 mmol). The metal pieces were washed once with dry THF (20 ml) with the help of a syringe. Dry THF (200 mL) was introduced into the flask and the stirred suspension was cooled on an ice-water bath. Dimethyl(phenyl)silyl chloride (Aldrich) (26.1 g, 153 mmol) was added drop-wise to the stirred suspension over 10 min and the reaction mixture was stirred under those conditions for 6 h to give a deep red colour solution of the dimethyl(phenyl)silyl lithium.
A separate 1 L three-neck round bottomed flask, fitted with a septum, an argon inlet/outlet and a stirring bar was charged with freshly distilled diethyl ethoxymethylene-malonate (31 mL, 153 mmol) and dry THF (350 ml). The stirred solution was cooled on a dry-ice-acetone bath (–78 °C) while the dimethyl(phenyl)silyl lithium solution was cannulated into it over 0.5 h. After the addition was over, the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min and the cold bath was removed. The reaction mixture was allowed to attain to room temperature (about 0.5 h) and poured into saturated ammonium chloride solution (150 mL). The mixture was further diluted with water (200 mL) and extracted with ether (3 × 200 mL). The organic extract was washed with water (2 × 200 mL) and with brine (100 mL), dried (MgSO4) and evaporated. The residue was distilled to give diethyl [dimethyl(phenyl)silyl]methylenemalonate (34.2 g, 73%) as a colorless oil; B. p. 125-126 °C (0.08 mmHg)
