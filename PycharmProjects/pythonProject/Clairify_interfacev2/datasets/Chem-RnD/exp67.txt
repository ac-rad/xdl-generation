The alcohol (1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-6-O-p-toluenesulfonyl-alpha-D-galactose) (143.6 g, 0.55 mol) was dissolved in pyridine (288 mL) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (145.4 g, 0.84 mol, 1.5 equiv.) was added in portions allowing the internal temperature to reach 60 ºC (on a large scale cooling in a cold water bath may be necessary).  The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 4 hours while slowly cooling to room temperature resulting in an orange suspension.  A small amount of ice-water (10 mL) was added slowly (carefully on large scale) while cooling the mixture to 0 °C in an ice bath.  This resulted in crystallisation of the desired product (after solvation of the pyridinium salt).  Additional cold water (400 mL) was added slowly in portions until crystallisation no longer took place.  The mixture was allowed to stir for 15 minutes after which the product, a pale orange solid, was collected by filtration and washed with a little petroleum ether.  Purification was achieved by recrystallisation from methanol to yield the desired product as a white crystalline solid (183.1 g, 87 %).
(Caution: large quantities of pyridine are employed.  Dispose of all pyridine waste (including aqueous fraction) in an appropriate manner.)
