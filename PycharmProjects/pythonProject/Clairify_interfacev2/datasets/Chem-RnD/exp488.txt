To a solution of the benzaldehyde (200 mg, 0.91 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dry chlorobenzene (10 mL) were added ACCN (335 mg, 1.37 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) and tert-dodecanethiol (553 mg, 2.73 mmol, 3 equiv.) (Note 1). The solution was sparged by bubbling argon through the solution for 30 minutes after which the solution was maintained under an atmosphere of argon and heated at 100 Â°C for 20 hours. After removal of the solvent in vacuo (ensure adequate ventilation due to pungent thiol), the resulting oil was purified by column chromatography (2 x 25 cm column of silica gel, EtOAc-PE, 1 : 3) to give the benzopyran-4-one (136 mg, 68% [92% based on recovered benzaldehyde], Rf = 0.63 in EtOAc-PE, 1 : 1) and starting benzaldehyde (52 mg, 26%, Rf = 0.55 in EtOAc-PE, 1 : 1).
