Caution:
Isopropyllithium is highly flammable, pyrophoric and reacts violently with water releasing highly flammable gas. All operations should be conducted with oven dried glassware which has been allowed to cool under an atmosphere of argon.

Lithium (12.0 g, 1.73 mol, 3 eq.) is suspended in petrol (145 cm3) in a 500 cm3 round bottom flask fitted with a pressure equalising dropping funnel and a condenser. The temperature of the vigorously stirred suspension is raised to reflux for 1.5 - 2 h, during which time the solvent becomes discoloured as oxide is cleaned from the surface of the lithium. The external heat source is then removed and approximately 2 cm3 of isopropyl chloride (total 53 cm3, 576 mmol) is added. An exothermic reaction initiates, and the remainder of the isopropyl chloride is added dropwise over 1 - 1.5 h at such a rate that reflux is maintained throughout. Following complete addition the purple solution continues to reflux under the reaction’s exotherm for approximately 1 h. External heat is then reapplied such that the reaction is at reflux for a further hour.
The reaction is then allowed to cool to room temperature under a fast stream of argon. The condenser and dropping funnel are quickly replaced with stoppers and a filter stick (approximately 5 cm in diameter) fitted into the third neck. Filtration under argon of the suspension through the glass sinter into a 250 cm3 round bottom flask gives a colourless solution of isopropyllithium in petrol, which is titrated (against 2,2,2’-trimethylpropionanilide)1 as 1.3 - 1.6 M.
