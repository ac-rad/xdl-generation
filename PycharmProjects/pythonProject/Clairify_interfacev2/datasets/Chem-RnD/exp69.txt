This reaction was carried out under nitrogen.

Allyl bromide (10ml, 0.115 moles) was added to a stirred solution of sodium (2.65g, 0.115 moles) and dimethyl malonate (6 ml, 0.0522 moles) in methanol (200 ml) at room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into ether (3 x 50 ml). The organic layers were combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and water (3 x 50 ml of each) and dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of the solvent "in vacuo" gave the  crude product. Purification was carried out by chromatography using petrol:ether (20:1) as eluent to give the product as a colourless liquid (4.78g, 43%).
