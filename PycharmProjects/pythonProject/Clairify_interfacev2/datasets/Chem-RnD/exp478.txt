Preparation of Silica-HClO4 catalyst: Perchloric acid (1.25 g, as a 70% aqueous solution) was added to the suspension of silica gel (23.75 g, mesh 230-400) in Et2O. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was heated at 100 °C for 72 h under vacuum to afford HClO4-SiO2 as a free flowing powder (For details, see: Chakraborti, A. K.; Gulhane, R. Chem. Commun., 2003, 1896-1897 http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/B304178F)
Procedure for deformylation: Silica-perchloric acid (50% w/w, 50 mg) was added to the solution of indole-3-carboxaldehyde (100 mg, 1 mmol) and anthranilamide (94 mg, 1 mmol) in acetonitrile (6 mL). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 6 h at reflux temperature (80 °C). The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (EtOAc: n-hexane - 1: 9). After completion of the reaction, it was allowed to cool and the catalyst was recovered by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated to get crude product, which after silica gel (mesh 100-200) column chromatography using 10% EtOAc in n-hexane gave indole (65 mg, 80% yield). The product was characterized by comparison of TLC of the product (Rf 0.4 in EtOAc: n-hexane - 1: 9) with commercially available sample (CAS Number 120-72-9; Sigma Aldrich: Catalog no. W259306). It was also confirmed by comparison of NMR data with literature values (Motoyama, Y.; Kamo, K.; Nagashima, H. Org. Lett. 2009, 11, 1345-1348. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ol9001366)
