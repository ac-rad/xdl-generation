To a solution of 3-(4-methoxy-2-methoxycarbonylmethyl-6-tolyl)-propionic acid methyl ester (6.32 g, 23 mmol, 1 equiv) in THF (170 mL)cooled to -78 Â°Cwas added LHMDS (27 mL of a 1M solution in hexanes, 27 mmol, 1.2 equiv) dropwise.  The reaction was allowed to stir at this temperature for 30 minutes producing a red solution.  TLC analysis [9:1; Pet:EtOAc] identified complete product formation.  The reaction was quenched with NH4Cl solution (40 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  Purification was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with Pet:EtOAc (9:1 v:v) to yield the title compound as a white solid (2.22 g, 40%).
