A solution of (1R)-1-((3aS,6S,6aS)-6-methoxy-2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuro[3,4-d][1,3]dioxol-4-yl)allyl methanesulfonate (250mg, 0.81 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (5 mL) was degassed and kept under an atmosphere of argon or dinitrogenbefore addition of p-TSA (70 mg, 0.40 mmol). The solution was heated to reflux at 90°C for 70-72 hrs. After the conversion was complete as indicated by TLC (50% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether), the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and treated with triethylamine (approx. 2-3 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (30-60% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether as eluent) gave (2S,3S,4S,5S)-2-(dimethoxymethyl)-5-vinyltetrahydrofuran-3,4-diol (120 mg, 72%).
