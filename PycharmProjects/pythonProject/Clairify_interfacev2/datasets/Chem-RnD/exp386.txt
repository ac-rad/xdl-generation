To a solution of epichlorohydrin (1.4 mL, 10 mmol) and 3-chloroaniline (2.3 mL,10 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 ml), calcium triflate (1.8 g, 5 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and water (20 ml) was added to the residue. The product was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 20 ml) and the combined organic layer was washed with brine (2 x 20 ml), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography over silica gel using ethyl acetate-petroleum ether (3:97 to 12:88) as eluent to afford pure 1-Chloro-3-(3'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol (92 % yield).
