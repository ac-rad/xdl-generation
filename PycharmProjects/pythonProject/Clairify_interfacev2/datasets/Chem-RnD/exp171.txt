To a solution of the vinylsulfonate (250 mg, 0.91 mmol) in dry toluene (15 mL) was added AIBN (10
mg), and 2-iodo-2-methylpropane(3.0 eq., 0.50 g, 2.7 mmol) and the solution heated to 100 °C. Tributyltin hydride (2.5 eq., 0.66 g, 2.3 mmol) was added dropwise over 20 mins and the reaction allowed to heat for a further 2h. Potassium fluoride (ca. 1.5 g) was added and the resulting suspension stirred vigorously for 16h. The suspension was filtered through celite and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo.
The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (20-50% Ether / Petroleum ether
40-60 °C) to yield the product as a pale yellow, oil (257 mg, 0.77 mmol, 85%).
