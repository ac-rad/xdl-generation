General procedure: A mixture of aniline (0.5 mmol), benzyl chloride (0.5 mmolfor mono N‐benzylation and 2 mmol for N,N‐dibenzylation), K2CO3 (0.5 mmol for mono N‐benzylation and 1 mmol for N,N‐dibenzylation), SiO2‐Cu2O (0.1 g, 2.5 molpercent Cu for mono N‐benzylation and 0.2 g, 5 molpercent Cu for N,N‐dibenzylation), and tetra‐n‐butylammonium bromide (TBAB, 0.082 g, 0.25 mmol, only in the case of N,N‐dibenzylation) in water (5 mL) in around‐bottom flask (50 mL) was stirred at 30 Â°C for monoN‐benzylation and 100 Â°C for N,N‐dibenzylation. On completionof the reaction monitored by thin‐layer chromatography (TLC),the reaction mixture was filtered, and the residue was washed with water followed by ethyl acetate (3 Ã&#151; 10 mL). The combinedorganic extracts were washed with water (3 Ã&#151; 100 mL)and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removedunder reduced pressure, and the product was obtained by crystallization from petroleum ether or ethyl acetate/ petroleumether, or by eluting the crude product through a column of silica gel with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether.
