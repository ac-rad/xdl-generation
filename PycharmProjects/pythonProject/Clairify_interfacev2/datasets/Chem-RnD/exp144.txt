To a solution of magnesuim turnings (3.11 g, 128 mmol, 3.5 equiv) in THF (50 mL) was added a small amount of 2-bromotoluene (1 mL) and 1 iodine crystal.  The reaction vessel was heated until initiation occurred, where upon a solution of the remaining 2-bromotoluene (20 g,  117 mmol, 3.2 equiv in total) in THF (100 mL) was added.  The reaction was set to reflux for 2 hours (colour change to black solution), after which it was cooled to 0 Â°C and a solution of phosphorus trichloride (5.01 g, 36.5 mmol, 1 equiv) in THF (30 mL) was added dropwise.  Upon addition completion the reaction was set to reflux for 18 hours.  The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon NH4Cl solution was added with care.  The resulting solution was extracted with ether (3 x 100 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting white solid was recrystalised from ethanol to yield the title compound as a white solid.  (6.8 g, 62 %)
