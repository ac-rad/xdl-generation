A 100 mL Rotaflo/Young's ampoule was charged with TiCl4(THF)2 (4.0 g, 11.9 mmol) and THF (25 mL) and cooled to -78째C. Added dropwise, from a graduated ampoule, was nBuLi (4.8 mL of a 2.5M solution in hexane, 11.9 mmol, 1 equivalent), with the immediate formation of a pale blue/green solid and a brown solution. The vessel was allowed to warm to room temperature, evacuated, refluxed for 1 hour and then allowed to cool.
A separate vessel was charged with a slurry of LiCp* (3.36 g, 23.8 mmol) in THF (25 mL), which was added to the Ti(III) solution via wide-bore cannula. The reaction vessel was evacuated and heated to reflux for 2 days. A colour change to green is observed after an hour, after 18 hours (i.e. overnight) the suspension is purple.
After the allotted reaction time, the reaction vessel was cooled to 0째C and concentrated HCl was added (ca. 20 mL), resulting in the precipitation of a red solid. The contents of the reaction mixture were poured into chloroform (250 mL). The aqueous layer was discarded, and the organic phase dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, which was removed by filtration and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield a waxy red solid in near quantitative yield (determined by NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3 to be predominantly (C5Me5)2TiCl2, but containing some of the desired (C5Me5)TiCl3; this is not problematic in view of the next step)
The solid thus obtained was transferred to a 100 mL Rotaflo/Young's ampoule and dried under vacuum for 1 hour. Added via syringe was TiCl4 (0.9 mL, 1 equivalent relative to the amount of titanocene dichloride present). The ampoule was evacuated and heated to 140째C for 4 hours, after which time the solid was notably brighter red. Any residual TiCl4 was removed under vacuum. The red solid was transferred to the glovebox and collected. Yield 4.85 g (16.7 mmol, 70% (over 2 steps) based on LiCp*). Whilst spectroscopically pure, the solid could be further purified by sublimation at 150-160째C and 10-3 Torr
