Pyrrole was freshly distilled. benzaldehyde and propionic acid, purchased recently, were used as is. Pyrrole (1.9mL, 2.69E-2mol) and benzaldehyde (3.0mL, 2.69E-2mol) were combined in a graduated cylinder then agitated until thoroughly mixed.  Propionic acid (100mL) was added to a 250 mL round bottom flask fixed with a cold water condenser and heated to reflux.   The benzaldehyde and pyrrole mixture was added to the refluxing propionic acid and allowed to react for 30 minutes.  Color change to red/brown occurred rapidly and by the end of the reaction the crude solution was opaque.  The crude solution was cooled to room temperature then filtered using a Buchner funnel.
The reaction flask and filtered solid were washed with methanol leaving behind shiny purple crystals.  The filtered solid as well as the solid remaining in the reaction flask were then washed with methylene chloride into an oven dried and pre-weighed round bottom flask. The solution was concentrated to dryness then weighed for yield determination.
