To a solution of the alcohol (5.00 g, 29.41 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dry dichloromethane (100 mL) was added chlorotrimethylsilane (6.0 mL, 5.32 g, 35.29 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) at room temperature.  Distilled triethylamine (5.4 mL, 3.86 g, 38,23 mmol, 1.3 equiv.) was added over 5 minutes and the resulting mixture allowed to stir for 2 hours. The  white suspension was quenched with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (30 mL) and the organics washed with water (30 mL) and brine (30 mL), followed by drying over magnesium sulfate and solvent reduction in vacuo.  The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 10 : 1) to give product as a clear oil (4.98 g, 80 %).
