This reaction was carried out under nitrogen. t-BuLi (4ml, 6.8 mmols) added to the amide (1.031g, 5.89 mmoles) in THF (15 ml) at -78 °C and stirred at -78 °C for ten minutes to give a bright yellow solution. Propargyl bromide (3 ml, 26.9 mmols) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture which was then stirred for one hour and then water  (15 ml) added. The mixture warmed to room temperature and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. Purification by chromatography (petrol:ether, 1:1, 1:3, 1:8). Yield 830 mg, 66%.
