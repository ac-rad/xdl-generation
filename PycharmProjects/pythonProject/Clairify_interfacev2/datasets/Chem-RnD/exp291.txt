Powdered phthalic anhydride (74 g, 0.5 mol) and methanol (100 cm3, 2.47 mol) were heated under reflux with magnetic stirring on an oil bath for 8 h. The clear solution was distilled to remove most of the methanol. Toluene (100 cm3) was added to the residue and distillation was continued until the still-head temperature reached 110 ºC. After cooling to 30 ºC, the resulting thick white precipitate was filtered and the residue washed with toluene (50 cm3). Petroleum ether (30/40, 100 cm3) was added to the combined filtrates to give a dense oil which crystallised as long white needles after standing overnight. Filtration and washing with petroleum ether (60/80, 50 cm3) gave the product, 44.5 g, 49% yield.
