The two alkynes are stirred together at 0 Â°C in pyrrolidine and the copper iodide is added in one portion, initially creating a green coloured solution which quickly turns red/brown. The reaction is stirred at this temperature for 30 minutes-1 hour until completion (TLC), then quenched with ammonium chloride solution, extracted 4 times with ether, washed with brine, dreid over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. Purification is achieved by column chromatography eluting with 20-50% EtOAc/PE.
