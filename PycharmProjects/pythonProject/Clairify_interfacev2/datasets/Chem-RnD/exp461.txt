Procedure A: The synthesis was performed using standard Schlenk techniques under a nitrogen atmosphere. To a sealed scintillation vial charged with indene 1 (43.7 mg, 0.161 mmol), anhydrous 2-MeTHF (1.6 mL) was added. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and n-BuLi (0.070 mL, 0.161 mmol, 2.5 M solution in hexanes) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1 h. p-tolualdehyde (0.020 mL, 0.169 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was returned to RT and stirred for 20 h. TLC was used to monitor the reaction.* The reaction mixture was quenched and washed with saturated ammonium chloride (3 x 1 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 1 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a roundbottom flask, and further eluted with diethyl ether (3 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and purified using a preparatory plate (90:10, hexanes:toluene), yielding a light red solid, benzofulvene 2 (28.7 mg, 47%).
Procedure B: The synthesis was performed using standard Schlenk techniques under a nitrogen atmosphere. To a sealed scintillation vial charged with indene 1 (100 mg, 0.369 mmol), anhydrous heptane (3.7 mL) was added. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and n-BuLi (0.15 mL, 0.369 mmol, 2.5 M solution in hexanes) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was warmed to RT and stirred overnight.  A tan precipitate develops.  The heptanes was removed under reduced pressure and anhydrous 2-MeTHF (3.7 mL) was added.  The solution was cooled to 0 °C and p-tolualdehyde (0.048 mL, 0.406 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was returned to RT and stirred for 20 h. TLC was used to monitor the reaction.* The reaction mixture was quenched and washed with saturated ammonium chloride (3 x 2 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 2 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a roundbottom flask, and further eluted with diethyl ether (3 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and purified using a preparatory plate (90:10, hexanes:toluene), yielding a light red solid, benzofulvene 2 (81.0 mg, 59%).
*An aliquot was removed from the crude reaction mixture and diluted for TLC.
