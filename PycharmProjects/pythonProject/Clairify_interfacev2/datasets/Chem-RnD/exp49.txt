A suspension of aluminium (III)chloride (76.58mmol, 10.21g) in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (10mL) was cooled to 0°C and chloroacetyl chloride (61.26mmol, 4.88mL) was added dropwise with stirring over 5 mins.  The resulting mixture was then allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 1h.  The resulting suspension was then re-cooled to 0 °C and a solution of N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamine (30.63mmol, 5.0g) in 1,2-dichloroethane (35mL) was added dropwise over 15 mins to produce a pale yellow solution.  This was allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 1h and then heated to 45 °C for 2h.  After this period tlc revealed that the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was poured, carefully, onto a mixture of ice/water and conc.HCl (20mL) and the resulting mixture was extracted with DCM (3 x 150mL). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (200mL)and brine(200mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave a yellow solid.
This was recrystallised from ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (40/60) to give a colourless solid (5.70g, 78%).
