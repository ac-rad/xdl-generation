To a solution of (±)-(E)-2-[4-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)-1-pentenyl]-4,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (1.00 g, 3.06 mmol) in THF (10 mL) under Ar at room temperature, was added sodium hydroxide (1.84 mL, 9.19 mmol, 5 M in de-ionized water). The reaction mixture left to stir at room temperature for 10 minutes then a solution of iodine (1.555 g, 6.13 mmol) dissolved in THF (5 mL) was added dropwise over ca. 1 minute. The reaction mixture was left to stir at room temperature for 4 h in the absence of light, followed by the quenching with 5 % aqueous sodium metabisulfite solution (40 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 25 mL), the combined organic extracts were washed with 5 % aqueous sodium metabisulfite solution (40 mL), water (40 mL), brine (40 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether as eluent), to give (±)-(E)-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-1-iodopent-1-ene (714 mg, 71%) as a light sensitive yellow oil (E-isomeric purity > 99%).
