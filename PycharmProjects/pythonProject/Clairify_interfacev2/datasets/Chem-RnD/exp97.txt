Neodymium powder (1.00g) and a large excess of hexachloroethane (3.00g was used in this case as in the original reference) were placed in a schlenk flask in a glove box. THF (40 ml) was measured out into a graduated schlenk and then added to the first schlenk via cannula, all of which, of course, was done under nitrogen or argon (alternatively you can just use a large gas tight syringe, again under inert atmosphere). The the schlenk tap was closed and the schlenk secured in a sonic bath and left to sonicate until ALL the metal powder disappeared (you should see some precipitate of the neodymium chloride beginning to come out of solution once the reaction has taken place). The sonication method for neodymium takes about 3-4 days depending on whether you keep the sonication going all the time or not. You must make sure all the metal powder has gone otherwise it will contaminate your product and is hard to get rid of. Pentane (20ml)is then added to the solution. After the brown percipitate had settled out the solution was filtered from the solid,(via a filter cannula), washed with pentane (1x20ml), and dried for 10 minutes under vacuum.
