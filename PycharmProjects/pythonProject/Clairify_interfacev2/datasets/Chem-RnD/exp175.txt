Preparation of 4-(1-Pyrenyl)butyric amide (2): To a stirred solution of 1-pyrenebutyric acid (1) (4.279 g, 14.84 mmol) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (cat. amount) in anhydrous dichloromethane (100 ml) under argon at r.t. was added dropwise oxalyl chloride (1.36 ml, 1.05 equiv). After 30 min (gas liberation  after 2 min) the suspension was refluxed for 1.5 h. The yellow solution was cooled to room temperature and excess NH3 bubbled into the reaction mixture (instantaneous formation of precipitate).  The reaction mixture was then partioned between water (300 ml) and ethyl acetate (500 ml).  The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 400 ml), the combined organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was crystallised from ethyl acetate (400 ml) : n-hexane (100 ml) to give (2) (2.875 g, 67 %) as slightly yellow small needles; m.p. 180-181 째C, m.p. 181.5-182 째C (after three crystallisations); Rf = 0.72 (ethyl acetate : ethanol 9.5 : 0.5). Further quantities of (2) were obtained by crystallisation from the mother fraction using ethyl acetate: n-hexane to give (2) (0.553 g, 13.0 %); m.p. 180-182 째C.
Preparation of 4-(1-pyrenyl)butyl amine hydrochloride (4): To stirred reflux solution of (2) (3.154 g, 11.0 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (17 ml) under argon was added dropwise (30 min) BH3.Me2S (2.7 ml, 2.5 mol equiv, gas liberation). The reaction mixture was then distilled over 1.5 h to remove the Me2S / tetrahydrofuran (8 ml). The reaction mixture was cooled to r.t., and methanol (4.5 ml, 3 mol equiv) was added dropwise (vigorous gas liberation). The reaction mixture was poured into an aqueous HCl solution (3M, 100 ml, pH < 4, formation of precipitate). The mixture was cooled (ice/water bath), basified with aqueous NaOH solution (pH > 9), extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 100 ml), the combined organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give 4-(1-pyrenyl)butyl amine (3) (2.916 g, 97 %) as a yellow viscous liquid. HCl gas was bubbled into a solution of the amine (3) dissolved in anhydrous diethyl ether (50 ml). The resulting precipitate was filtered to give 4-(1-pyrenyl)butyl amine hydrochloride (4) (2.942 g, 89 %) as brown cubes; m.p. 232(dec)-259 째C.
