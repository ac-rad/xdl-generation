Procedure a: To a stirred solution of o-toluidine (10 g) and triethylamine (9.41 g) [not necessarily dry] in anhydrous DCM (50 mL) cooled to 0 Â°C was slowly added a solution of pivaloyl chloride (11.2 g) in anhydrous DCM (c.a. 10 mL/ 100 mmol).  Upon complete addition stirring was continued for a further 30 minutes and then poured into water (200 mL).  The organic layer was washed with water (3 x 100 mL) and dried over sodium sulphate.  The crude white solid afforded on solvent evaporation was recrystallised twice from hot DCM / hexane (12/80 mL) to afford the title compound as a white solid.  Yield 83 %.
Procedure b: To a solution of N-pivaloyl-o-toluidene (70-100 mg) in anhydrous THF (c.a. 1 mL) in a flame dried, nitrogen flushed flask was slowly added n-BuLi [microsyringe] until a colour change was evident [bright yellow].
