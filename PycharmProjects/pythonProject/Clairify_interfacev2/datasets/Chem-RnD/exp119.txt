p-Toluenesulfonyl bromide (6eq, 0.6mmol, 142mg) and AIBN (6eq, 0.6mmol, 98mg) were pre-dissolved in dry toluene (1mL) and added to Wang polystyrene resin (coupled to 5-hexynoic acid as shown above) (1eq, 0.1mmol, 0.72mmol/g, 139mg).  The reaction was performed in a 3 mL ReactivialTM at 65-70Â°C with stirring for 20 h and allowed to cool to room temperature.  The resin was then transferred to a filter tube and washed with DCM, DMF, THF 6 x 10mL each; 3 x 10 mL each of DMSO, glacial acetic acid, 20% DIPEA/DMF. Final wash in THF.
Cleaved with 3 mL 95% TFA(aq) for 2.5 h.  Washed through with DCM and THF and dried under stream of nitrogen.  
Yield: 94%, colourless oil.
