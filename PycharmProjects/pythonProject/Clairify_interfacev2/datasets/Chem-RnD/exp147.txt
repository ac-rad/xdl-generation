In a high pressure vessel was placed 2-bromo-5-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-acetonitrile (17.6 g, 73 mmol, 1 equiv), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (2.57 g, 3.67 mmol, 5 mol%), P(o-tolyl)3 (3.35 g, 11 mmol, 15 mol%), ethyl acrylate (8.8 g, 88 mmol, 1.2 equiv), triethylamine (11.1 g, 110 mol, 1.5 equiv) and toluene (22 mL/g nitrile).  The vessel was purged with nitrogen, sealed and slowly cooled to -78 °C.  The vessel was evacuated at this temperature, sealed and allowed to slowly warm to room temperature.  The vessel was then heated to 165 °C for 16 h, after which it was allowed to cool to room temperature and was washed with water (200 mL).  The organics were extracted into ether (3 x 200 mL)and washed with a further portion of water (100 mL).  The combined organics were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting brown oil was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with petrol:ethyl acetate (5:1 v:v) as the eluent yielding the title compound as a yellow solid (9.0 g, 48%)
