To pentafluorophenyl vinyl sulfonate (5 g, 18.24 mmol) in dry toluene (50 mL) was added C-phenyl-N-methyl nitrone (6.2 g, 45.59 mmol), and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 hours. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo, and the crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (starting 16:1 Hexane/Et2O) to give the title compound (4.9 g, 65%) as an off-white solid.
