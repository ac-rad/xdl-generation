A mixture of 3-(2-cyanomethyl-4-methoxy-6-tolyl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester (9.0 g, 35 mmol, 1 equiv) and magnesium turnings (3.38 g, 139 mmol, 4 equiv)was stirred at 0 °C in methanol (200 mL).  Initiation of the reaction was achieved by the addition of 1 crystal of iodine to the solution.  Stirring was continued for 6 h at 0 °C.  To the resulting grey/green solution was added NaOH (6.94 g, 173 mmol, 5 equiv) and water (200 mL) and the reaction heated at 130 °C for 36 h.  The resulting grey solid was acidified to pH 1 with conc HCl and the organics extracted into DCM (c.a. 1L).  The organics were then washed with 6N NaOH (400 mL).  The combined NaOH extracts were acidified to pH 1 and extracted with DCM (2 x 500 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo yielding a fawny white solid (6.56 g, 75%)
