To a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with stir bar was added 5-bromo-2-furanoic acid (6.69 g, 35 mmol, 1 equiv) and dichloromethane (120 mL, ≈ 0.3M). To this stirred heterogenous1 solution was added 1,1’-carbonyl diimadazole (6.24 g, 38.5 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) in one portion, turning the solution from milky white to a clear yellow and resulting in the evolution of CO2 gas.2 The now yellow solution was allowed to stir for 45 minutes. At this time, N-O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.76 g, 38.5 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added all at once turning the solution a cloudy white. The reaction mixture was stirred for six hours. The reaction mixture was then quenched with 50 mL of 1 M HCl3 and stirred vigorously for 10 minutes. After this time, the solution was transferred to a separatory funnel and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2 X 100 mL). The combine organic layers were washed with 1 M HCl (100 mL), deionized water (100 mL) and a 1:1 mixture of brine and a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL). The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation  to afford the pure amide, 5-bromo-N-methoxy-N-methylfuran-2-carboxamide (5.70 g, 70%).
