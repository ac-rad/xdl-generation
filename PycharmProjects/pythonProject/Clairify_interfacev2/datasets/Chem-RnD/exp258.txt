2-Phenylglycinonitrile hydrochloride (0.20 g, 1.5 mmol, 1 equiv) was suspended in an aqueous solution of NaOH (1 M, 10 mL) and the free amino nitrile was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL), washed with brine (20 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and carefully concentrated on a rotary evaporator so as to avoid losing the amino nitrile. The resulting free amino nitrile and Hünig’s base (0.58 g, 0.78 mL, 4.5 mmol, 3 equiv) were dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL) and CO2 was bubbled through the solution. The CO2 gas was produced by filling a RBF with cardice, allowing the cardice to sublime and pass through 4 Å molecular sieves in a Dreschel bottle, before being introduced into the reaction solution via a syringe needle. The solution was stirred at RT with CO2 addition for 17 h, by which time TLC analysis indicated full consumption of the amino nitrile. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator and the resulting paste suspended in water (5 mL). The suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) and the combined organic components were washed with HCl (0.1 M, 10 mL), water (10 mL), brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Crystallisation from ethanol afforded 5-phenylhydantoin (0.20 g, 73%) as a colourless solid.
