To the solution of thiophenol (100 mg, 1.0 mmol) in 0.1% TFA in water (5 mL) was added formaldehyde (80 µl, 3 equiv.). The resulting reaction mixture was then refluxed at 80 °C for 10 min. The ortho-cresol (108 mg, 1.1 mmol) was then added and reaction mixture was further stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography using EtOAc: hexane as mobile phase to yield pair of products, one with para-substituted o-cresols 1a (55%) and other with ortho-/para-disubstituted o-cresols 1b (28%).
