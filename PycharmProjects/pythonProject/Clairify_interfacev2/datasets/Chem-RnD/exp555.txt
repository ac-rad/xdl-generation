Urea (0.48 g, 8.0 mmol) and ytterbium(III) triflate (0.26 g, 0.4 mmol) were added to a 1 dram (3.7 mL) glass reaction vial. Then, the 3:1 acetic acid:water solvent mixture (2 mL) was added to the vial; next, the methyl acetoacetate (0.86 mL, 8 mmol) was added, followed by the aldehyde (4 mmol). The stirred solution was heated for 15 minutes at 95 Â°C and developed an intense yellow colour. The reaction vial was cooled to room temperature; and, its contents were poured into a 25 mL beaker with 2 mL of ice and 5 mL of deionized water to fully precipitate the product. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration using a hirsch filter. The solid was washed with cold water (5 mL), then with toluene (5 mL); removal of the residual solvent by rotary evaporation provided the product in reasonable purity.
