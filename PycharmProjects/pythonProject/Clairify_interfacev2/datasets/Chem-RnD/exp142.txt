To a mixture of decane-1,2-diol (0.174 g; 1 mmol) and triethylamine (0.505 g; 5 mmol) in toluene (30 cm3) was added benzoyl chloride (0.705 g; 5 mmol).  The mixture was heated for 7 minutes in a domestic microwave oven (Sharp, 800 W, 2450 MHz) that had been adapted to fit a reflux condenser, (which was on).  Alternatively, the mixture was lowered into an oilbath preheated to 140 °C. (Seven minutes was timed from when the internal temperature reached 109 °C.)
The mixture was allowed to cool, during which time a solid precipitated (triethylamine hydrochloride).  The mixture was filtered, then the solvent removed at reduced pressure with minimal heating (no more than 40 °C; a reasonable vacuum is required for this, i.e. water pump or house vacuum is not sufficient.  We used a 'Divac' 2.2L capacity.)
The concentrated product was washed through a silica plug using petrol ether, until all excess benzoyl chloride was removed.  The product, 1-benzoyloxy-2-hydroxydecane, could be obtained using ethyl acetate.  Further purification, if required, necessitated a larger column (isolated yield after second column chromatography 0.250 g; 90%).
