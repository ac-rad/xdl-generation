A mixture of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzyl alcohol (250 mg, 1.6 mmol) , methyl 2-cyanobenzoate (260mg, 1.6 mmol) and BF3.Et2O (2.5 ml, 48-50% BF3) was heated at 75-80° C under nitrogen atmosphere for 10-12 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC (neat DCM). The reaction mass was quenched in 10% sodium carbonate solution and extracted with DCM (10 x 2 ml). The crude product was purified by column chromatography (using 230-400 mesh silica gel) using dichloromethane (neat) to yield the pure product as a yellowish solid (250 mg, 58% yield).
