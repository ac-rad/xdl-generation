2-Pyridine carboxaldehyde (20 mL, 0.21 mol) and diethyl ether (20 mL) were added to a flask containing dried magnesium sulphate (BDH) (5 g). The flask was cooled to 0°C and n-propylamine (19 mL, 0.25 moles) was added slowly. The mixture was removed from the ice bath and stirred for two hours at 25°C prior to filtration. Diethyl ether was removed by rotary evaporation and the resulting yellow oil was purified by vacuum distillation. 

The product was obtained as a straw-colored oil (bp. 43°C at 7 E 10-2 mbar). Yield = 98 %
