Add amine(61.5 mmol, 5 eq, 7.80 mL) to about 20 mL DCM and cool in ice-water bath, add acetic acid (61.5 mmol, 5 eq, 3.52 mL) dropwise to form salt as a slurry.  Add slurry to resin (12.7g, 0.967 mmol/g, 12.3 mmol, 1 eq) preswollen in minimum volume DMF.  Shake vigorously for about 20 min to form iminium species on solid support.  Add Me4NBH(OAc)3 slurry in DMF (5 mL) to resin and mix well; shake overnight at room temp.  Wash small sample thoroughly with DMF, DCM, Methanol and test for consumption of aldehyde using 2,4-DNP spot test - see separate page.
If reaction complete, wash bulk resin sample as described above but if aldehyde still present, add Me4NBH2(OAc)2.  Prepare this from Me4NBH4 (1 eq) and acetic acid (2 eq) - mix together in DMF until no further evolution of nitrogen gas is observed.  Add this to the reductive amination reaction above to drive imine reduction to completion.
Yield typically 70-95 % as assessed by FMOC test - see separate synthetic page
