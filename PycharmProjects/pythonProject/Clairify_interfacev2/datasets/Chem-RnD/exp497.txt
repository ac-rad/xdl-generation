2-Cyano acetic acid (80 mmol) & Isobutanol (360 mmol) was added to a 1Lt, 4 necked flask carrying mechanical stirrer, addition flask and condenser. Concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, 94 mmol) was charged to addition flask and added drop wise at room temperature. The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained between 80-85°C for 16–18 hours. Then the reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature and poured into 20% sodium carbonate solution. The reaction mass was extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The combined organic layer was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain product with (60-70%) yield.
