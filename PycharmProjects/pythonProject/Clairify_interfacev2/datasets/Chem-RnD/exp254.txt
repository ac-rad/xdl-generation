Methyl (S)-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-pyroglutamate (10 g, 0.041 mol; Coudert at al., 1997) was dissolved in dry THF (100 ml) under argon, and cooled to -78 C (acetone-dry ice bath). Lithium triethylborohydride solution (45 ml; 1 M in THF) was slowly added to this solution (by syringe) upon stirring over 10 min. After 2 hour at -78 C 4-dimethylaminopyridine (100 mg), diethylisopropylamine (30 ml; in 10 min by syringe) and trifluoroacetic anhydride (7 ml; 0.050 mol; in 3 min by syringe) were added and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. Water (50 ml) was added rapidly in stirred solution, mixture was transferred in round-bottom flask and organic solvents were evaporated on rotor evaporator. Mixture was extracted by diethylether (3 x 100 ml), ether fraction dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (diethylether/hexane, 3:7) to yield the product as a pal yellow oil (7.80 g, 0.034 mol; 84%).
