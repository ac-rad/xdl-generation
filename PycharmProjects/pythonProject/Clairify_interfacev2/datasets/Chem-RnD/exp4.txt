A 250 ml round bottomed flask with a sidearm was charged with Cu2O (3.64 g 25.4 mmol) and a stirrer bar. The round bottomed flask was evacuated and flushed with argon. Benzene (150 ml) was added via cannula and trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride (10.0 g 35.4 mmol) was syringed into the stirred suspension. The reaction mixture was refluxed for several hours (overnight) with a double surface water condenser attached and argon gently passing across the top of the condenser. The solution gradually changed colour from bright red to a "grey" solution. The hot solution was filtered through a very small amount of dry Celite on a wide frit (we use a 5 cm diameter), to remove any insoluble matter. On cooling a white solid precipitated from the solution. The solvent was removed by filtration and the off-white solid was washed with benzene (2 x 20 ml). The solid was dried in vacuo and stored in an inert atmosphere (argon glovebox). Yield close to quantitative.
