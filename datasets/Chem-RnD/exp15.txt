This procedure is used for the chemoselective reduction of enones to produce allylic alcohols, in this case (and many others) with a good degree of stereospecificity. The enone and cerium trichloride are stirred in methanol at 0C and the sodium borohydride is added portionwise over about 15 minutes; some effervescence should be seen. Stirring is continued at this temperature until completion (TLC), usually about 1.5-2 hours, then quenched with ammonium chloride solution, extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dreid over magnesium sulphate, filtered, concentrated and purified by column chromatography eluting with 20% EtOAc/PE
