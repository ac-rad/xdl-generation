The synthesis was performed under ambient atmosphere. To a microwave reaction vial charged with indene  (0.204 g, 1.06 mmol) was added 3-chlorobenzaldehyde (0.154 g, 1.10 mmol), DBU  (0.172 g, 1.13 mmol), and 2-MeTHF (2 mL, 0.53 M). The vial was then heated via variable watt microwave irradiation to 60 °C for 10 minutes with a 30 second pre-stirring period. Upon completion a yellow sheen was observed on the sides of the vial. The reaction mixture was quenched using a silica plug. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was purified via preparative chromatography, (90:10 hexane:toluene) yielding the title compound as a crimson red solid, (0.190 g, 58%).
The synthesis was also performed on a 100 mg scale (indene) yielding 90 mg of the title compound (55%).
