To a 50 mL round bottom flask equipped with stir bar  containing a solution of CH3ONa (11.2 g, 0.20 mol) in 10 ml dry methanol  was added rapidly CuCl (1 g, 0.01 mol) 2-bromo-3,4,5-trimethoxy-1-methylbenzene (26.0 g, 0.1 mol) and dry DMF (3 ml) in sequence under an N2 atmosphere . The reaction mixture was raised to 120 ℃  and maintained at this temperature for 8 h (solution turns blue in colour). After cooling to ambient temperature, a solution of 5M HCl(40ml) was added, and the mixture was reﬂuxed for another 0.5 h , The mixture was cooled and extracted with petroleum ether (3×80 ml), and the combined extracts were washed with brine (4×80 ml). The solution are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and solvent was removed in vacuo to afford a slightly yellow oil 2,3,4,5-tetramethoxytoluene (19.6 g) in 92.5% yield
