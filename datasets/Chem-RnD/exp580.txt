3-Acetylindole (10.007 g, 63.262 mmol, 1 eq.), 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine  (1.542 g, 12.62 mmol, 0.2 eq.) and triethylamine (26.3  mL, 188 mmol, 3 eq.) were dissolved in dichloromethane (500 mL) and stirred at room  temperature for 30 minutes. Trimethylacetyl chloride (10.8 mL, 88.0  mmol, 1.4 eq.) was added and the solution was stirred at room  temperature for 4 days. The reaction mixture was washed with water (1 x 100 ml) and dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent was filtered off and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude  product was purified by column chromatography (1:4 ethyl acetate:hexane on SiO2), giving white crystals (13.036 g. 86%).
