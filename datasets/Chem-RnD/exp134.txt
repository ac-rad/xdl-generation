A solution under N2 of 4-bromo-3,5-dimethylanisole (39.5g, 183.8mmol), N-bromosuccinimide (32.7g, 183.8mmol), benzyl peroxide (2.23g, 9.19mmol) in CCl4 was heated at reflux at 80Â°C for 3h. After cooling to r.t, the light yellow solution filtered and concentrated to give an orange oil which precipitated a yellow/white solid. Recrystallisation from 9:1 hexane/ethyl acetate yielded white crystals of  3-bromomethyl-4-bromo-5-methylanisole (17.5g, 32.4%).
