Diphenylsulfide (0.09 ml, 0.10 g, 0.54 mmol) and AlCl3 (0.10 g, 0.75 mmol) were dissolved in 2-tert-butylphenol (15.35 ml, 15.02 g, 0.10 mol) in a three neck round bottom flask, under nitrogen flow. The flask outlet was fitted with a sat. NaOH(aq) scrubber. The solution was cooled in an ice bath, and sulfuryl chloride (7.97 ml, 13.4 g, 0.10 mol) was added dropwise over ca 40 min. The solution became yellow, then red, and was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The solution was concentrated and purified by vacuum distillation using a 12 cm Vigreux column. Fraction results summarised below.
