2.3 Alternative Synthesis of 23; A solution of n-butyllithium (30 mL, 75 mmol, 2.5M in hexanes, 3.75 eq) was added slowly to dry THF (60 mL), and then cooled to -7Â° C. Gaseous propyne (670 mL, 30 mmol, 1.5 eq) was added at -7Â° C. After complete addition of the propyne gas, the mixture was stirred for 1 h at -5 to 0Â° C., warmed to RT and stirred at that temperature for further 80 min. A solution of solanesyl chloride, 21, (purity 75.5percent by weight, 17.3 g, 20 mmol, 1.0 eq) in THF (80 mL) was then added dropwise to the aforementioned solution at temperatures between 0 and 2Â° C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 0Â° C. for 90 min and then poured into aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution. The organic phase was separated, the water phase was washed once with ethyl acetate (60 mL), the combined organic phases were washed with brine, and then dried over sodium sulphate. After removal of the solvents under reduced pressure 17.6 g of a light brown oil was obtained, containing 60.0percent weight-percent of solanesyl alkyne substrate, 23 (yield: 80.9percent).; 2.4 Alternative Synthesis of 23; A solution of n-butyllithium (24 mL, 60 mmol, 2.5M in hexanes, 3.0 eq) was added slowly to dry THF (50 mL) at -40Â° C. Gaseous propyne (670 mL, 30 mmol, 1.5 eq) was gassed in at -40Â° C. After complete addition of the propyne gas, the cooling bath was removed and the mixture allowed to warm to 0Â° C., at which temperature it was stirred for additional 3 h. A solution of solanesyl chloride, 21 (purity 92.8percent by weight, 14.0 g, 20 mmol, 1.0 eq) in THF (60 mL) was then added dropwise to the aforementioned solution at temperatures between 0 and 5Â° C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 0Â° C. for 2.5 h and then poured into aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution. The organic phase was separated, the water phase was washed once with ethyl acetate (50 mL), the combined organic phases were washed with brine and dried over sodium sulphate. After solvent evaporation under reduced pressure 13.8 g of a light brown oil was obtained, containing 71.8percent weight-percent of solanesyl alkyne, 23 (yield: 76.0percent).; 2.5 Alternative Synthesis of 23; A solution of n-butyllithium (30 mL, 75 mmol, 2.5M in hexanes, 6.25 eq) was added slowly to dry THF (60 mL) at -40Â° C. Propyne gas (670 mL, 30 mmol, 2.5 eq) was added to the mixture at -40Â° C. After complete addition of the propyne gas, the cooling bath was removed and the mixture allowed to warm to 0Â° C., at which temperature it is stirred for 1 h. The suspension was then warmed to RT in 30 min and stirred for 1 h at RT. The aforementioned suspension was cooled again to -20Â° C.- -25Â° C., and a solution of solanesyl chloride, 21 (purity 75.5percent by weight, 10.24 g, 11,8 mmol, 1.0 eq) in THF (50 mL) was then added dropwise to the aforementioned solution in the same temperature interval. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1.5 h at temperatures from -25Â° C. to -10Â° C. At -10Â° C., the mixture was poured into aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution. The organic phase was separated, the water phase was washed once with ethyl acetate (50 mL), the combined organic phases were washed with brine and dried over sodium sulphate. After solvent evaporation under reduced pressure 10.5 g of a light brown oil was obtained, containing 76.2percent weight-percent of solanesyl alkyne, 23 (yield: 83.0percent).
