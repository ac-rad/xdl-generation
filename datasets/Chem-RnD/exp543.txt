To a stirred 0°C solution of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene (3.5 mL, 6.00 g, 20.5 mmol) in THF (100 mL) was slowly added a 2.0 M solution of iPrMgCl in Et2O (10.7 mL, 21.4 mmol). The reaction mixture was left to stir under N2 at 0°C for 30 minutes, before BF3∙OEt2 (0.84 mL, 0.97 g, 6.8 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then immediately warmed to room temperature and the volatiles were removed under vacuum to give the crude product as an off-white solid foam. The foam was left to dry under vacuum for an hour before being broken up using a spatula. The crude product was then sublimed twice (160°C, 0.5 mbar) to give B{C6H3(3,5-CF3)2}3 (2.5 g, 3.8 mmol, 56%) as a white powder.
