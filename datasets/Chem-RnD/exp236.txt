Firstly a 25 ml round bottom flask was flame dried and fitted with a reflux condenser. Pre-dried 4A molecular sieves (approx 200 mg) were added at room temperature under nitrogen along with N,N'-dimethylurea (0.22 g, 2.5 mmol, 1 eq.) and anhydrous toluene (3 ml), forming a slurry. To this, phenylacetaldehyde (0.58ml, 5 mmol, 2 eq.) and BF3.Et2O (63 microlitres, 0.25 mmol, 10 mol%) were added and the solution heated to reflux (~115C) for 2-4 h and followed by thin layer chromatography (100% ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.46). On completion the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (approx 9 ml) and the sieves removed. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the resulting oil purified by column chromatography (100% ethyl acetate)
