To a solution of the carbohydrate (3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl bromide) (138.1 mg, 0.351 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dry acetonitrile (13.81 mL) was added tetraethyl ammonium chloride (232.4 mg, 1.27 mmol, 3.6 equiv.) and the mixture allowed to stir for 10 minutes at room temperature (protected from light).  The reaction mixture was poured into dry toluene (80 mL), washed with cold water ( 5 x 15 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed in vacuo.  This gave the desired product as a white solid (118.7 mg, 97 %).
