Under a dinitrogen atmosphere, lithium aluminium hydride (3 mg, 0.08 mmol) in diethyl ether was stirred at 0Â°C. The 3,4-dihydro-5H-Benzo[cd]pyren-5-one (20 mg, 0.08 mmol) was dissolved in THF and added to the mixture slowly and the solution left to stir at room temperature for 1 h.After 1 hour, water and then HCl was added (1:3) sequentially under a dinitrogen atmosphere.The organics collected and dried with Na2SO4 and solvent removed under vacuo, to obtain a crude orange solid.The crude was columned using (8:2) petroleum ether: ethyl acetate to obtain a pinkish powdered solid (19 mg, 94%).
