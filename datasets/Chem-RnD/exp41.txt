Dibenzylideneacetone (4.60 g, 19.6 mmol) and sodium acetate trihydrate (6.47 g, 47.5 mmol) were placed in a one necked 500 mL round bottomed flask with a sidearm and the flask fitted with a stopper. The side arm was attached to a double manifold Schlenk line and the flask cycled three times vacuum/Argon. Under a flow of argon the stopper was removed, methanol (150 mL) was added and the flask re-stoppered. The reactants were dissolved at 50 °C. Under a flow of argon the stopper was removed for a second time, PdCl2 (1.05 g, 5.9 mmol) was added and the flask was re-stoppered again. The side arm tap and Schlenk line tap were both left open to argon. An oil bubbler was attached to a second tap of the Schlenk line and the tap opened to argon. The mixture was heated at 40 °C with stirring under an oil bubbler presure of argon for 4 h after which a dark purple/black precipitate had formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel and washed 1st with water (70 mL) and 2nd with acetone (70 mL). The product was dried under vacuum to yield 3.12 g of a dark purple solid (92% yield).
