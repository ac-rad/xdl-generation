To a solution of 1,3,5-trimethoxy-2-((E)-3-methylbut-1-enyl)benzene (100 mg, 1 mmol) in TFA (5 ml) was added hexamethylenetetraamine (237 mg, 4 mmol) and resulting mixture was heated to reflux at 120 °C for 6 h. Completion of the reaction was monitored by TLC (by observing disappearance of starting material on TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with EtOAc (50 ml x 3).  Combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated on rotary evaporator to give a yellow oil. Purification by silica gel (mesh 100-200) column chromatography using 40% EtOAc: hexane as eluent gave 2,4-diformyl-1,3,5-trimethoxy benzene as light yellow solid (80 mg, 84% yield). The product was characterized by comparison of melting point and NMR data with literature values (Kuhnert, N.; Rossignolo, G. M.; Lopez-Periago, A. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003, 1, 1157-1170.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/B212102F)
