Synthesis of (c-Hex)2BOTf; A mixture of BH3•NEt3 (7.00 ml, 47.2 mmol) and cyclohexene (19.6 ml, 189 mmol) was stirred at 80 °C in a Schlenk flask under nitrogen for 22 h. More cyclohexene (4.90 ml, 47.2 mmol) was added, and the mixture heated to 100 °C for 13 h. The volatile compounds (Et3N and cyclohexene) were removed by distillation at 120-150 °C under nitrogen. The (c-Hex)3B was distilled at 170 °C at 0.8 mmHg into another Schlenk flask [(c-Hex)3B is a white solid at room temperature]. TfOH (4.20 ml, 47.2 mmol) was then added carefully to the (c-Hex)3B at ambient temperature and the mixture heated to 70 °C to melt the (c-Hex)3B (care taken as the mixture can start to reflux vigorously), cooled to 35 °C and stirred for 1 h. The product was distilled at 130-140 °C at 1 mmHg into another Schlenk flask, to give (c-Hex)2BOTf (13.4 g, 87%) as a yellow solid which was used without further purification. Reaction; (c-Hex)2BOTf (6.50 g, 20.0 mmol) in hexane (10 ml) was added to a stirred solution of methyl acetate (0.72 ml, 9.1 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (20 ml) at 0 °C under N2. Et3N (3.20 ml, 23.0 mmol) was then added. After stirring for 30 min at 0 °C, isobutyraldehyde (2.10 ml, 23.1 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was warmed to ambient temperature and stirred for 5 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of pH 7 aqueous potassium phosphate buffer and methanol (1:1, 20 ml). More methanol (50 ml) was added and the flask cooled to 0 °C. H2O2 (20 ml of 30 % w/w in water) was added carefully and the mixture stirred at ambient temperature for 15 h. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue partitioned between water (20 ml) and CH2Cl2 (20 ml). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (20 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with water (20 ml) and brine (20 ml), dried (MgSO4) and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Most of the cyclohexanol by-product was removed as an azeotrope with xylene under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with 1:4 EtOAc-petroleum ether to give the double aldol adduct (1.30 g, 66%) as white solid.
