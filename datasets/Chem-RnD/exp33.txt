Phenyl vinylsulfone (0.5 g, 3.0 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (15 mL) and 1-iodobutane (550 mg, 3.0 mmol) was added. The solution was heated to reflux and tributyltin hydride (0.86 mL, 930 mg, 3.2 mmol) and AIBN (20 mg) were added as a solution in cold toluene (5 mL) over 10 mins. The solution was allowed to reflux for 2 hours after which time the reaction was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Potassium fluoride solution (sat. 1.0 mL) was added and the reaction stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours. The resulting suspension was filtered through celite and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography (5-10% Ether / Petrol) to yield the product sulfone as a clear oil (365 mg, 1.6 mmol, 52%).
