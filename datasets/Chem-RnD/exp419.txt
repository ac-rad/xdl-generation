Solid (R)-phenylglycinol (2.0 g, 14.5 mmol) and phthalic anhydride (2.16 g, 14.5 mmol) were heated with stirring to 145Â°C for 4 h. The obtained yellow oil was dissolved in DCM (50 ml) and the solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the product was used in the subsequent step without further purification. Yield 3.7 g (95%).
