Dimethyl (2RS)-2-(N-(methyloxycarbonyl)amino)-6-oxopimelate  (300mg, 1.04mmol) was treated with a solution of CH2N2 in diethyl ether at 0Â°C for 1h.  Solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue purified by flash chromatography (50% EtOAc in hexane, Rf 0.5; 10% CH3CN in CH2Cl2 was also effective, Rf 0.27) to give Dimethyl (2RS, 6RS)-2-(N-(methyloxycarbonyl)amino)-6-epoxymethanopimelate as a colourless oil (273.4mg, 91%).
