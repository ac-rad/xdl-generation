To a stirred solution of alpha-methylcinnamic acid (250 mg, 1.54 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 cm3) at room temperature was added palladium (II) chloride (25 mg, 0.14 mmol), zinc powder (275 mg, 4.2 mmol) and L-(+)-tartaric acid (694 mg, 4.6 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated and  the resulting residue was subjected to column chromatography [stationary phase: silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063 mm)], eluting with a 7:3 mixture of petroleum ether:ethyl acetate to afford (S)-2-methyl-3-phenylpropanoic acid (86%, 216 mg).
