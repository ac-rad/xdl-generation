To a round bottom flask* charged with 2,2,3-trimethylindolenine (1.59 g, 10 mmol) was added 1,4-butansultone (4.09 g, 30 mmol) and toluene (20 mL).  The red solution was heated to reflux for 5 hours, with constant stirring.  Upon completion, the dark reaction mixture was allowed to cool, and the solid was isolated by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel, washed with ethyl acetate and air dried to yield the target compound (0.52 g, 17.63 %) as a lilac solid.
