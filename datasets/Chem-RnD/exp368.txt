To a 100 mL 2 neck flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen were added the boronic acid (530 mg, 2.11 mmol), dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate (443 mg, 2.11 mmol), Cu(OAc)2 (383 mg, 2.11 mmol) and powdered 4Å molecular sieves (100 mg, ca. 20 wt%). Anhydrous CH2Cl2 (40 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 min before distilled triethylamine (1.47 mL) was added. After stirring for a further 18 h the reaction mixture was filtered through a plug of celite and concentrated to a crude oil. Purification via flash column chromatography (4:6, EtOAc-hexanes) and concentration yielded an oil. Precipitation of the product via addition of hexanes (50 mL) and subsequent filtration then furnished the desired product as a white solid (832 mg, 95%);
