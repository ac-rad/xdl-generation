A solution of oxalyl chloride 12.7 g, 100 mmol) in methylene chloride (50 ml) was added to a solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (7.7 ml, 100 mmol) in methylene chloride (100 ml) at 00C over 30 min.  After complete addition the cold bath was removed and the mixture stirred for a further 30 min.  The solution was then re-cooled to 00C, and to it was rapidly added a solution of pyrrole (6.9 ml, 100 mmol) in methylene chloride (50 ml).  The resulting brown solution was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and aluminium chloride (29.3 g, 220 mmol) was then added cautiously via powder funnel, followed  by 2-chloro-2-methylpropane (10.9 ml, 100
mmol).  The resulting mixture was stirred for either (a) 2 h or (b) 24 h.  After this time, the reaction mixture was neutralised with NaOH (30% solution).  The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous fraction was exhaustively extracted with methylene chloride.  Concentration under reduced pressure of the combined organic phases gave a brown residue.  This material was redissolved in pentane, filtered through celite, and recrystallised by cooling to -350C.  The product is thus obtained as a white crystalline solid in 65-75 % yield (ca. 10 -12 g)
