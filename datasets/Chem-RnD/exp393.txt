3‘,5‘-di-O TBDMS deoxyadenosine ( 479 mg, 1 mmol, prepared as per Ogilvie, K. K. Can. J. Chem. 1973, 51, 3799-3807) was dissolved in n-propanol (2.5 mL) in a 10 mL RB flask. Freshly prepared tertbutyl hypochloride (50 microliter, 0.5 mmol, freshly prepared as per OSCV 5, p187, 1973 ) was added to the reaction mixture through a microliter syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min and the n-propanol was removed almost 50-70% using high vacuum (should not be heated, this is to remove excess hypochloride). To the viscous mass, again added n-propanol (2.5 mL) followed by freshly prepared 1M NaOH solution (0.5 ml/500 microliter)was added dropwise over 5 min which turns the reaction mixture light brown. After 10 min, a solution of (DHQD)2PHAL ( 20 mg ) in n-propanol (0.5 mL) was added followed by diolepoxide(143 mg) in one pot in powder form (which forms a slurry). To this a freshly prepared solution of potassiumosmate ( 5 mg ) in water (0.25 mL) was added in 5-10 sec and stirred for about 3 h. During the course the reaction mixture becomes clear and light brown. TLC observation using 80:20 hexane:petroleum ether, clearly shows the floresent spot of the product under UV light. The reaction mixture added to ethylacetate (50 mL) and extracted. And given water wash (25 ml). Water layer again extracted with ethylacetate. The comined ethylacetate was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to get crude product (~650 mg), which is purified by HPLC. These diastereomers can easily seperated on a normal phase preperative silica HPLC column (ethyl acetate and hexane as eluent. HPLC eltion gradient : 0-5 min only hexane, 2-30 min gradient from 0-100% ethylacetate and then only ethylacetate 100% for 5 min and monitoring at 343 nm. At this wavelength only pyrene products are detected). Prep TLC also can be used for purifying the compound. Yield: 332 mg (85%) for both the diasteriomers. While HPLC purification, these diasteriomers can be easily seperated to give almost 50:50 each diasteriomers.
