The nitrile (510 mg, 4.76 mmoles) in ether was added to LAH (1.5 g, 39.5 mmoles) in ether (15 ml) and stirred at room temperature overnight. Sodium hydroxide (2.8 ml, 10% solution) was added at 0 Â°C and after 30 minutes, water (5 ml)  was added to give a granular precipitate. The mixture was filtered and the precipitate washed copiously with ether. The combined, washed and dried organic layers were evaporated "in vacuo" to give the product as an oil (292 mg, 55%). .
