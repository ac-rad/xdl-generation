Potassium carbonate (0.59 g, 4.26 mmol, 1.05 eq.) was added to a solution of 5-(hydroxy)picolinaldehyde (0.50 g, 4.06 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in DMF (15 ml). Propargyl bromide (80% in toluene, 0.475 ml, 4.26 mmol, 1.05 eq.) was added to the reaction via syringe. The round bottomed flask was fitted with a condenser and the solution was stirred at 100°C for 4 h before allowing to cool to ambient with stirring for an additional 1 h. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure. The crude solid was then taken up in chloroform (150 ml) and filtered. This process was repeated a further two times (2 × 40 ml). The chloroform was then removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure to leave an orange solid, which was dried overnight in vacuo. Yield = 0.32 g, 1.99 mmol, 49%.
