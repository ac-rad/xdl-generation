To a well-stirred mixture of 2-bromo-3-phenylpropanoic acid (10.0 g, 43.65 mmol) in methanol (100 mL) at about 0 °C was added p-Toluenesulfonic acid (1.5 g, 8.73 mmol) in portion wise manner. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 10-12 min. The reaction mixture was added about 20% sodium bicarbonate solution (50-60 mL). Excess methanol from reaction mixture was evaporated on rota evaporator and remaining reaction mass was extracted in ethyl acetate (100 mL × 2). The combined organic layer dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the product methyl 2-bromo-3-phenylpropanoate (10.2 g, 96 %). All examples gave NMR pure Products (95-98 %).
