A solution of the cyclopentenol (344 mg, 1.22 mmol, 1 equiv.), in distilled tetrahydrofuran (6 mL), was cooled to -78 ºC and lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LHMDS) (3.1 mL of a 1 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 3.05 mmol, 2.5 equiv.) was added.  The mixture was allowed to stir for 2 hours keeping the temperature constant at -78 ºC; acetaldehyde (0.084 mL, 59 mg, 1.34 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) was then added.  The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0 ºC over 2 hours, after which the reaction was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride solution (6 mL).  Extraction with diethyl ether (2 x 12 mL) was followed by washing of the organics with water (12 mL) and re-extraction of the combined aqueous layers with ethyl acetate (12 mL/mmol).  The combined organic fractions were dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent reduced in vacuo.  The crude oil was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 10 : 1 to 5 : 1) to yield the product as a pale yellow solid (185 mg, 46 % (92 % based on recovered sm)). Also obtained was starting material (172 mg, 50 %).
