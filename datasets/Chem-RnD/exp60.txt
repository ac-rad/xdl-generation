The carbohydrate (1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-6-O-p-toluenesulfonyl-alpha-D-galactose) (40.0 g, 93.0 mmol) was dissolved in distilled benzene (90 mL) and the solution added to a suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (4.2 g, 110.7 mmol, 1.13 equiv.) in distilled diethyl ether (180 mL) (under nitrogen).  The resulting mixture was heated at reflux (55 ºC) for 15 hours with strong magnetic stirring.  The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and excess wet diethyl ether (20 mL) was added carefully at 0 °C.  This was followed by slow portionwise addition of aqueous potassium sodium tartrate solution (Rochelle's salt) (20 mL) until all lithium aluminium hydride had been destroyed (i.e. production of hydrogen gas had ceased) [Avoid addition of too much water].  The suspension was allowed to warm to room temperature, filtered and the residue washed with a little diethyl ether (50 mL).  The filtrate was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed in vacuo.  This gave the crude product which was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether (40-60°)/ethyl acetate, 10:1, 5:1) to yield the desired compound as a white solid (15.5 g, 66 %) and some recovered starting material (7.1 g, 18 %).
