Glyoxal-bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imine (35.27g, 0.094mol) and NaBH4 (14.3g, 0.376mol) were placed into a two necked round bottom flask with a stirbar. The flask was fitted with a condenser and a hosing adapter with a teflon stopcock was attached to the top of the condenser. The apparatus was attached to a double manifold Schlenk line and cycled vac/argon three times and left open to argon. THF (300 mL) was added via canula. An oil bubbler was attached to a second tap of the double manifold and oppened to argon. The mixture was heated at reflux for 17h under an oil bubbler pressure of Ar and then cooled to ambient temperature. 5M HCl (300 mL) was added dropwise until fizzing had ceased and a white precipitate had formed. The solid was collected on a frit and washed with water (100 mL) and Et2O (200 mL). The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 45 Â°C for 17h to yield 37.33 g of product (88% yield).
