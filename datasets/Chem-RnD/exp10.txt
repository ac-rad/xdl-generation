BuLi (11.2 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of indole in THF (40 ml) at -78 o C. After about 30 minutes CO2 (gas - dried through CaCl2 tube) was passed through the solution which was then allowed to stand for 10 minutes and the solvent was evaporated at 0 °C (1 mm Hg- using a pump attached directly to the reaction vessel). This takes about an hour. The resulting material (white solid) was then dissolved in THF (40 ml) and cooled to -78 °C. t-BuLi (18.7 mmol) was then added dropwise and the solution stirred for about 20 minutes. TsF (1.91 11 mmol) in THF (8 ml) was then added at -78 °C and the mixture stirred at this temperature for one hour and then allowed to warm to r.t. The reaction was then stirred at room temperature for a couple of hours and the solkution then poured onto ice-brine solution and then extracted with ether. Purification was by chromatography using silica-gel, and petrol:ether as eluent (20:1, - 3:1, gradient) to give the product (1.04 g, 35%)
