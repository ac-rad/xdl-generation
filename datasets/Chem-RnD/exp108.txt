To a suspension of 1,1,1-triacetoxy-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one (DMP)(1.19 g, 2.79 mmol, 3 equiv.) in dry dichloromethane (5 mL) was added a solution of the starting material (342 mg, 0.93 mmol, 1 equiv.) also in dichloromethane (5 mL).  The resulting white suspension was allowed to stir for 30 minutes at room temperature after which it was quenched with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (5 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (15 mL) and ethyl acetate (15 mL).  The organics were washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (5 mL) and brine (5 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed in vacuo.  The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 3 : 1) to yield the desired ketone as a yellow solid (310 mg, 91 %).
