To a 250 mL two necked flask was charged acetonitrile (100 mL), ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (14 g, 53 mmol), benzyltriethylammonium chloride (24 g, 106 mmol) under nitrogen atmosphere. The red colour solution was stirred for 15 min. To this solution, benzyl chloride (6.3 g, 50 mmol) was added slowly at room temperature in 5 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4-6 h until the disappearance of starting material by TLC. Acetonitrile was concentrated by vacuum to about 80%. To the black slurry, diethyl ether (75 mL) was added and filtered through a small pack of silica (about 35 g silica on a sintered filtration assembly). The black sludge was collected back in to the glass flask and, about 20 mL of acetonitrile was added and made the black mass into thick slurry and to this added diethyl ether (75 mL) and filtered again. This procedure repeated for 2 more times. The filtered ether layer was washed with water (200 mL) and dried over sodium sulphate. This diethyl ether solution was passed through a narrow path of silica gel (about 50 g on a sintered filtration assembly) and concentrated to give dibenzyldisulfide as the only product 5.30 g (86%).
