To a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar was added CsF1 (1.670 g, 10.99 mmol, 0.2 equiv). Toluene (138 mL, ≈ 0.4 M in the Weinreb amide) was rapidly added2 to the flask, followed by N-methoxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methylpropanamide3 (12.27 g, 54.96 mmol, 1 equiv). The flask was sealed with a septum equipped with two inlet needles as an exit valve. The flask was cooled to 0 °C for 10 minutes4.   TMS-CF3 (15.61 g, 109.91 mmol, 2 equiv) was added to the reaction mixture dropwise over a period of ≈ 10 minutes. After completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 10 minutes at 0 °C. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature. CAUTION: Upon reaching room temperature, the reaction occurs and is mildly exothermic and gas is evolved.5 After completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature. Reaction progress was monitored by 1H NMR.6,7
Once complete conversion to the silylated intermediate was confirmed, the toluene was removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation. Hexanes (40 mL), followed by deionized water (55 mL) followed by 1M solution of TBAF in THF (55 mL, 55 mmol, 1 equiv8) were added to the reaction flask. The flask was equipped with a reflux condenser, open to air. The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C in an oil bath and allowed to stir 2-3 hours. Once cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture were diluted with Et2O (≈ 120 mL), and transferred to a separatory funnel. The organic layer was washed with deionized water (2 X 60 mL each), followed with a brine solution (1 X 120 mL). The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation to yield the crude trifluoromethylketone. Further purification was accomplished vacuum distillation (b.p. 68-71 °C @ 0.2 mmHg) affording the pure CF3 ketone (9.28 g, 73%)  as a clear colorless oil.
