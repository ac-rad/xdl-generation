To Grubbs catalyst (10mg, ~5 mol%)in a 5 mL round bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser under nitrogen stirring in  dichloromethane (2ml) is added diethyldiallylmalonate (0.23mmol, 0.054ml) and the purple solution refluxed until completion (TLC, about 1 hour), then cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuum.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 10%EtOAc/PE to give yields of 90% (44 mg) or more.
