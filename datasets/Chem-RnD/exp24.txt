A solution of 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-propen-1-ol (0.89 g, 10.0mmol) and 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride(1.01 g, 6.60 mmol) in acetonitrile (100 mL) were placed in a 150mL, water cooled, pyrex immersion well reactor (purchased from Photochemical Reactors Ltd, Reading). The solution was degassed for 10min by the passage of nitrogen through a long syringe needle. The solution was then irradiated for 6 h under nitrogen using a 125W medium pressure Hg lamp. After this time the lamp was switched off and the apparatus left to cool for 10min. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a sticky solid which was washed with diethyl ether (30 mL) and dried to yield the product as a colourless solid (1.54 g, 97%); mp 160-162?C.
