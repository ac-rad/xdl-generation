To the solution of 3-acetyl indole (100 mg, 1 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 ml) was added DMAP (4 mg, 0.05 mmol), p-toluenesulfonyl choride (131 mg, 1.1 mmol)) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (164 Âµl, 1.5 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 h. Reaction was then quenched by the addition of 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl). The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (50 ml X 3), and combined organic layer was evaporated on rotary evaporator. Purification by silica gel column chromatography (mesh 100-200) using EtOAc-hexane (2: 98 to 10: 90) as mobile phase gave 1-(1-tosyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethanone as white solid (167 mg, 85% yield). It was confirmed by comparison of NMR data with literature values. (Che, Z.; Zhang, S.; Shao, Y.; Fan, L.; Xu, H.; Yu, X.; Zhi, X.; Yao, X.; Zhang, R. J. Agric.
