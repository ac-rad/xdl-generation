HfCl4 (7.7 g, 24.0 mmol) was suspended in diethyl ether (100 ml) and stirred for 1 hour.  The suspension was then cooled to -78 Â°C and the Grignard (100 ml, 1.0 M in diethyl ether) was added dropwise over 30 min.  The creamy off-white mixture obtained was stirred overnight in the dark (use aluminium foil).  After this time a the solution had turned yellow.  The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was extracted with warm heptane (3 x 75 ml).  The combined extracts were concentrated to ca. 100 ml and cooled to -30 o C.  The product is obtained as fine yellow needles after cooling for several hours at this temperature.  Yield = 10 g, 78%
