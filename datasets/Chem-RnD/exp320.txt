Cyclohexylamine (4 g, 0.04 mole) was added to a solution of dimethylcyanamidodithiocarbonate (5 g) in ethanol. On cooling [ice bath], N-cyano-N1-cyclohexyl-S-methylisothiourea separated  (5.77 g, 73%). The isothiourea (3.9 g, 0.02 mole) was dissolved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate (5 ml) and the mixture heated under reflux for 3 h. Water was added. The ethanol was boiled off and the solution was cooled [ice bath] to afford the triazole (2.2 g, 61%).
