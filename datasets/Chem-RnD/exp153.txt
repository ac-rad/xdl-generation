To a solution of 2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoic acid methyl ester (2.0 g, 8.1 mmol, 1 equiv) in methanol: water (111 mL:37 mL) was added NaOH (755 mg, 19 mmol, 2 equiv).  The reaction was set to reflux for 24 h, after which it was cooled to room temperature and the methanol removed in vacuo.  The resulting brown solution was acidified to pH 1 and the creamy suspension extracted into DCM (3 x 100 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo yielding the title compound as a fawn coloured solid.
