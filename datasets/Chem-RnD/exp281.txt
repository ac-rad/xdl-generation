Sodium acetylide (2.4 g, 0.05 mol) was suspended in dry THF (50 ml) under argon and cooled to -78°C. Selenium powder (3.8 g, 0.048 mol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to 0°C and was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to -78°C and MeOH was added dropwise (30 ml). The mixture was stirred for 15 min and was allowed to warm to 0°C and was stirred for another 2.5 h. From this point on all of the operations were performed in the dark. All of the solutions used were kept at 0°C at all times. The mixture was quenched with water (60 ml) and extracted with pentane (5 ×30 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (2 × 30 ml) and dried over Na2SO4. The solvents were removed in vacuo without heating. Obtained red solid was immediately used in the following reaction or stored overnight under nitrogen, in the dark at -30°C. Yield 2.4 g (24%).
