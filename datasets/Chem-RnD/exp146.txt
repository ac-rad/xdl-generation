To a solution of 2-bromo-1-bromomethyl-5-methoxy-3-methyl benzene (24.7g, 0.084 mol, 1 equiv) in DMSO (1.25 mL/mmol; 105 mL) was added a solution of sodium cyanide (7.4 g, 0.151 mol, 1.8 equiv) in DMSO (40 mL) by aid of a dropping funnel.  The resulting golden solution was heated to 90 Â°C for 2 h and allowed to cool to room temperature.  The resulting brown solution was poured into 1.5 L of ice water to give a fawn cloudy solution.  This was extracted with ether (2.5 L in total) to give a brown solution.  The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to yield a brown solid which was seen to be of sufficient purity for use in further stages. (17.6 g, 87%)
