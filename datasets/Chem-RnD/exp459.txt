To a 1 L RB flask formaldehyde 37% v/v (270.9 mL, 3.64 mol) and Formic acid (320 mL, 8.15 mol) was added. The reaction mixture was placed in an ice bath and Tris(2-Aminoethyl)amine (50 mL, 0.33 mol) was added dropwise over the course of at least 1h, with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was then refluxed at 120°C for 12 h (until the evolution of carbon dioxide had stopped).  After leaving to cool, the volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation to give an orange-yellow solution. The reaction mixture was placed in an ice bath and the pH was adjusted to pH 10 with a saturated NaOH solution. The resulting oil was then extracted using 3x 150 mL of Chloroform. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and the volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation to yield an orange-yellow oil. The oil was then distilled under reduced pressure (75-79°C, 10-3 mbar) to yield a colourless oil (48.01 g, 62 % yield).
