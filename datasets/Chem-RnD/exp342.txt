A mixture of 2-methylindole (0.1 g, 0.762 mmol), 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (0.105 g, 0.762 mmol), α-methylbenzylamine   (0, 09 mL, 0.726 mmol) and TFA  was stirred at room temperature for 4-5 h. After completion of the reaction (checked by TLC 40% ethyl acetate in Hexane Rf : 0.3) the reaction mass was quenched with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (5 mL) and stirred for 1-2 h. A light brown solid was observed which was isolated by filtration and washed with hexane (5mL). The title compound was thus obtained as light brown color solid (0.19 g, 68%).
