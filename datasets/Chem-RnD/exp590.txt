General procedure: To 4-{[2-(4-carboxy-phenyl)-pyrimidine-5-carbonyl]-cyclopropyl-amino}-piperidine-1 - carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (10 pmmol, 4.7 mg) in N,N-dimethylformamide (0.1 pL)is added ethyldiisopropylamine (5 p L) and 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1 -yl)-l ,1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (3.2 mg) and the mixture is stirred for 10 mm at room temperature. The corresponding amine (10 pmol) is added and the mixture is stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Aqueous K2003 solution (3 M, 20 pL) is added and stirring is continued for 10 mm. Subsequently the mixture is filtered through basicaluminum oxide, washed with N,N-dimethylformamide/methanol (9:1) and concentrated in vacuo to yield the desired amide.
