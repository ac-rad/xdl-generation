Bis(1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene)palladium(0) (14 mg, 0.016 mmol) and KOtBu (133 mg, 1.19 mmol) were placed in an ampoule fitted with a teflon stopcock in a glovebox and the ampoule  sealed.  The ampoule was removed from the glovebox and a septum fitted under a flow of argon.  Dioxane (10 mL) was added.  4-Chlorotoluene (93 microL, 0.79 mmol) followed by  morpholine  (83 microL, 0.95 mmol) were injected through the septum into the ampoule.  The ampoule was resealed and the mixture heated at 100 Â°C for 30 mins.  The reaction was judged to be complete by HPLC analysis and the mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature.  The solvent was removed in vacuo and the mixture filtered through a silica plug with 20 % EtOAc/hexane.  After removal of the solvent a white solid was obtained.  The solid was dried under vacuum to yield the product (137 mg, 98% yield).
