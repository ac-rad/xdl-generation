A dry one-neck 500 ml RBF with a PTFE stopcock sidearm, containing a very large egg-shaped magnetic follower and a fresh SubaSeal fitted to the joint, was set up as detailed below. Using Schlenk techniques under argon, n-butyllithium (100 ml 2.5 M in hexanes) was added from a measuring vessel (volume too large to be handled safely by syringe) followed by dry pentane (200 ml). The solution was cooled to -40°C in an acetone /dry ice bath with stirring and dimethylamine gas bubbled through the solution such that the internal reaction temperature was maintained between -29°C and -26°C. A white solid precipitated immediately. After around 1 h of cautious gas addition (regulating flow and sometimes switching off altogether) it was found that gas addition no longer led to an exotherm and no additional precipitation was detected. The system was allowed to warm to ambient temperature with gentle stirring under argon. The white precipitate was left to settle for some time and then isolated by cannula filtration, washed with pentane (2 x 50 ml), filtered again and dried in vacuo. Yield 12.08g (95 %)
