The synthesis is performed under nitrogen, however, all work up procedures are carried out in air.  A mixture of RhCl3(H2O)6 (2.0 g, 6.3 mmol), deoxygenated ethanol-water (5:1, 20 mL) and  1,5-cyclooctadiene (3 mL) were heated at reflux under nitrogen for 24 h, during this time period the product precipitated as a yellow-orange solid.  After the reflux time was complete, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the product was collected by filtration on a pre-weighed glass frit.  The product was washed with pentane and methanol-water (v/v, 1:5, ~50 mL). The resulting yellow-orange powder was dried in vacuo (10-3 mbar) for 24 h. Yield: 1.47 g, 2.98 mmol, 95%.
