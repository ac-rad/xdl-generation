Into a 1L three-way RBF equipped with magnetic stirring, a reflux condenser, addition funnel and nitrogen inlet was added iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (2.62 g, 9.41 mmol) and 300 mL of water. The head space was purged with nitrogen for 15 min and the solution brought to a boil with a sand bath. A solution of 2-(4-methylphenoxy)benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate Page 311(2.81 g, 9.41 mmol) in 300 mL of water was added dropwise to the RBF over the course of 30 min. The resulting oily, orange colored mixture was cooled to RT, extracted with diethyl ether (200 mL, 2 x 50 mL) and the pooled organic fractions washed with an equal volume of brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on 50 g of silica gel with hexanes (Rf = 0.36) affording 1.49 g (87.2%) of a white, crystalline solid after solvent removal.
