D-(-)-a-Phenylglycinol (2.00 g, 14.6 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (20 ml) and was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of sodium hydride (0.72 g, 30.0 mmol, 2.05 eq) in dry THF (10 ml). The solution was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. Iodomethane (0.96 ml, 15.4 mmol) was added dropwise and the solution was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. At this point, the solution was heated to reflux (65°C) for a further 2 h before cooling to ambient temperature, followed by the addition of brine (40 ml). The product was extracted with diethyl ether (4 × 60 ml), dried over sodium sulphate and the solvent was removed to leave a clear oil (crude yield = 1.80 g). This crude product was purified by Kugelrohr distillation to give a clear oil (bp 70°C under high vacuum). Purified yield = 1.38 g, 9.1 mmol, 63%.
