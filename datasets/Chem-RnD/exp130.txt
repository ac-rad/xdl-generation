To a stirred mixture of benzaldoxime (1.45 g; 12 mmol) and i-propyl bromide (1.23 g; 10 mmol) in DMF (33 cm3) at 0 Â°C was added cesium carbonate (3.98 g; 12 mmol).  The mixture was stirred overnight (at room temperature).  Water (25 cm3) was added, and the product extracted with ether (3 x 25 cm3), then washed extensively with water.  The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated.  Column chromatography (PE/EtOAc) gave O-i-propyl benzaldoxime as colourless oil (1.27 g; 78%).
