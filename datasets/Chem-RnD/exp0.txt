Lithium butyl (98.5 cm3, 2.50 M in hexanes, 3 equivalents) was added dropwise at -50°C to a solution of distilled tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) (12 g, 0.082 mol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (200 cm3). The mixture was stirred for 30 min. during which time it was allowed to warm to 0°C. The solution was then cooled to -50°C and a solution of sublimed tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane (37.1 g, 0.246 mol, 3 equivalents) in tetrahydrofuran (40 cm3) was added over a period of 5 min. The mixture was stirred for 30 min. with slow warming to 0°C. After evaporation of volatiles under reduced pressure at ambient temperature, a liquid nitrogen cooled probe was inserted into the flask in order to facilitate removal of the last traces of solvent in vacuo. The oily residue was extracted into pentane (3 x 50 cm3) and filtered. If required, this solution may be evaporated to give virtually pure H3(NN'3). Lithium butyl (98 cm3, 2.5 M in hexanes) was added dropwise to the combined extracts at -80°C. The mixture was allowed to warm slowly to -30°C and was stirred for a further 15 minutes. The solution was then cooled to -50°C and tetrahydrofuran (18 cm3, 3 equivalents) was added. The white microcrystalline solid which precipitated was isolated by cannula filtration and dried in vacuo (46 g, 78%).
