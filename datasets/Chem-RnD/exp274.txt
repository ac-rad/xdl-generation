A Schlenk vessel with stirrer bar was charged with [Zr(NMe2)4] (synthesis) (0.49 g, 1.84 mmol) and zirconium tetrachloride (0.43 g, 1.85 mmol). To this was added diethyl ether (50 ml) followed by THF (10 ml). The solution was stirred for 2 h during which time it turned a pale green colour. The solution was stirred for a further 2 h, filtered and concentrated. Upon keeping at –30 ºC for 48 h, a yellow/green crystalline solid had formed. This was filtered, washed with pentane at –78 ºC and dried in vacuo. Yield = 1.01 g, 70 %
