NaH(CO3) (42.185 g, 0.502 mol) was added to water (50 ml). The solution was stirred and placed in an ice bath. A solution of Co(NO3)2.6H2O (29.118 g, 0.100 mol), water (50 ml), and H2O2 (30%, 10 ml) was added dropwise to the ice cold slurry. On addition of the solution, the reaction mixture turned green. The mixture was kept at 0 °C for a further 1½ hours, whilst being continuously stirred. The green product was filtered, washed with cold water (3 x 10 ml), ethanol (2 x 10 ml), and diethyl ether (2 x 10 ml). The dark green precipitate was left to dry overnight under dynamic vacuum.
