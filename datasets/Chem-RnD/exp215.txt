The reaction is conducted in two stages, first the vinyl zirconocene is synthesised, followed by addition of the acyl chloride and palladium catalyst. Schwartz reagent is moisture and light sensitive so the reaction was conducted in oven dried glassware, flushed with an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) and protected from light. 

Schwartz Reagent (1.8 eq) was added in one portion to a solution of phenyl acetylene (1.5 eq) in anhydrous toluene (0.2M) with stirring. The mixture was warmed to 40 Â°C for 1 hr, at which point the mixture had turned from a white suspension to an orange solution. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and the benzoyl chloride (1.0 eq) and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (5 mol%) were added. Stirring continued for 3 hr at room temperature. Purification was carried out by column chromatography. The crude reaction mixture was loaded directly onto the column and eluted with a 2% EtOAc / petrol mixture to give the target material as a yellow solid in 79% yield.
