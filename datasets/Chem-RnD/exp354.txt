A mixture of para-cresol (22.00 g, 0.20 mol) and hexamethyldisilazane (85 mL, 0.40 mol) was stirred for 1 h under reflux. The reaction mixture was then vacuum distilled from the same flask using a short Vigreux column (10 cm). The fraction distilling at about 120 Â°C and 80 mbar was collected to give the product as a colorless oil (28.72 g, 80% yield).
