To a stirred solution of 4R-hydroxypyrrolidine-2R-carboxylic acid (5.02 g, 38.3 mmol, 1 eq. ) and [NAHC03] (8.05 g, 95.8 mmol, 2.5 eq. ) in H20 (85 mL) at 23 [Â°C] was added a solution of Cbz-Cl (6.28 mL, 44.0 mmol, 1.15 eq. ) in toluene (20 mL) over 15 min period. After 24 h the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (2 x 100 mL) and discarded the combined organic layer. The aqueous layer was then acidified to pH 2 with concentrated [HCI,] and the product was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The organic layer was dried and concentrated in vacuo to give [4R-HYDROXYPYRROLIDINE-1,] [2R-DICARBOXYLIC] acid [1-] benzyl ester 2-methyl ester (9.97 g, [100percent)
