1,4-di-n-hexyloxybenzene (2.00 g, 7.18 mmol) was added to a 250 mL flat-bottomed flask with 2.68 g (15.1 mmol, 2.1 equiv) of NBS. 20 mL of acetonitrile was added. A stirbar and water-cooled condenser was added, and the mixture was brought to reflux by heating on an open stir plate. The reaction was continued under reflux for 2 hours. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, causing a mass of white, needle-shaped crystals to form. The flask was cooled in a -20°C freezer and the white, crystalline product was collected by vacuum filtration on a Büchner funnel. The product was washed with cold acetonitrile until the yellow color of residual bromine was no longer visible, and dried in the air overnight. Yield; 2.71 g, 86%.
