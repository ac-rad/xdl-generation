The U material is radioactive so please follow your local rules. The reaction is performed under N2 or Ar using a Schlenk line in a fumehood.
Place the orange oxide (40 g, 0.14 mol) and hexachloropropene (100 ml, ca. 0.71 mol) in a 2-neck 1 litre round-bottom flask (500 ml is also possible) with the biggest magnetic follower you can find. We use an egg-shaped one. Fit an efficient condenser and thermometer such that the thermometer reads the temperature of the suspension. You will need a heating mantle through which a magnetic stirrer will operate. Make sure it's a good one like a Heidolph. We have also used a silicone or Lutron oil-bath. Heat the mixture slowly to about 60째C with gentle stirring. At about that temperature a fairly vigorous exotherm usually occurs, hence the use of an efficient condenser (see comments). Keep below 100째C and cool if necessary. After the exotherm subsides, heat the suspension to reflux (158-160째C) for 6 h. If you can't heat to this temperature you will probably need to heat for longer. The red solid gradually turns to a new green precipitate. After cooling, isolate this solid material by filtration as follows. Transfer the solid through a wide-bore cannula to a frit using dichloromethane to wash it over. Wash thoroughly with dichloromethane (at least 3 x 30 ml until the washings run pale or colourless). Dry the solid cautiously in vacuo on the sinter so that it is easier to scrape out. Transfer it to a Schlenk and dry in vacuo again at ambient temperature for an hour or so. Then heat in vacuo at 160째C for 24 h to remove any further volatiles. You should be left with the leaf-green free-flowing solid UCl4 (51 g, 96%)
