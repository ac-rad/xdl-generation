To a stirred solution of S-(But-3-enyl)-1-trimethylsiloxycyclohex-1-ene (Page 35) (3.76 g, 16.76 mmol) in diethyl ether (34 ml) under an argon atmosphere was added diethylzinc (33.4 ml, 33.4 mmol, 1M in hexane) and diiodomethane (2.69 ml, 33.4 mmol). The solution was heated to reflux for 17 hours after which a further 0.3 eq. of both diethylzinc and diiodomethane were added. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for a further 2.5 hours at which point the cloudy white solution was allowed to cool before the addition of pyridine (5.35 ml, 66.8 mmol). After stirring for 15 min petrol (200 ml) was added and the resulting precipitate filtered, the filtrate was evaporated to give a yellow liquid. Kugelrohr distillation (86-90 Â°C, 0.1 mmHg) gave a clear colourless liquid (3.24 g, 13.6 mmol, 81%)
