To 3,5-di-tert-butyl salicylic acid (2.5 g, 10 mmol) in a Schlenk vessel was added PPh3 (10.38 g, 4 eq), and the atmosphere in the vessel replaced with argon. Acetonitrile (25 ml), and then triethylamine (6 ml, 4 eq) were added, with stirring. 2 amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (0.89 g, 1 eq) was injected in a small volume of acetonitrile. CCl4 (10 ml, 10 eq) was added dropwise over 3 hours. The mixture was stirred for 48 hours, after which time the solution was filtered, washed through with Et2O, which caused a further precipitation, this precipitate was also removed by filtration. The solvents were removed in vacuo, and the product extracted with hexane (3 x 100 ml). The combined extracts were dried in vacuo, and the pale yellow powder was purified by flash chromatography on a silica column, eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate (50:1), affording the product as a pale yellow powder (1.4 g, 46%) after removal of solvent.
