A solution of the amide (1g, 4.06 mmol, 1 eq) in THF (10 mL) was cooled to -78Â°C, to which was added LHMDS (4.47 mL, 4.47 mmol, 1.15 eq) dropwise.  The pale yellow solution was stirred for 40 minutes at this temperature before the bromine (0.24 mL, 4.46 mmol, 1.1 eq) was added dropwise.  After 10 minutes of stirring the brown solution, the reaction was quenched by the addition of sat. NH4Cl solution (10 mL).  The mixture was diluted with EtOAc (10 mL) and washed with sat. NH4Cl solution (4 x 10 mL) and brine (2 x 5 mL).  The organic layer was dried with MgSO4.  The crude product was purified by recrystallisation in EtOAc to afford a white solid (0.79 g, 60 %).
