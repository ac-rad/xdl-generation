Triethylamine was added to a stirred solution of the pyranone in DMF (2.5 ml / mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 80 Â°C for 24 hours. The Solvent was then removed in vacuo to give a brown oil. This material was purified by chromatography on silica-gel using petrol:ethyl acetate (2:1, v:v) as eluent. This gave a yellow oil which crystallised on standing to give the product as a white solid (38.4 g, 78%).
