Lithium aluminium hydride (17 g, 0.43 mol) was suspended in dry THF (600 ml) under argon at 273 K. Solid L-Alanine (20 g, 0.22 mol) was added in small portions. The mixture was heated slowly to reflux overnight. A saturated potassium carbonate solution (~100 ml) was added very slowly to the mixture, which was cooled in an ice/water bath. The mixture was filtered and solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under high vacuum. Yield 12.7 g (77%).
