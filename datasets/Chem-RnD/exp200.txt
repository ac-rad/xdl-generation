To a slurry of 6-nitroveratraldehyde (5 g, 23.7 mmol) in methanol (50 mL) there was added 2-cyanoacetamide (2.2 g, 26.2 mmol), followed by piperidine (10 drops). The mixture was heated to reflux for 2 h, then cooled in an ice bath and finally filtered with suction. The intense-yellow crystals were washed with i-PrOH (30 mL) and air-dried to yield 5.6 g (100 %) of 2-cyano-3-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)acrylamide: mp 259-260 °C (literature[1]: 265-266°C)
