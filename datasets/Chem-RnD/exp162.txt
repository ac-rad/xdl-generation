A solution of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (310 ml; 3.28 mmol) was added to a stirred mixture of 1-phenylethanol (200 ml; 1.64 mmol) and the catalyst [10 mol % triphenylphosphine hydrobromide (TPP.HBr), 65 mg or pyridinium p- toluenesulphonate (PPTS), 50 mg] in 2 ml of ionic liquid (1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [bmim][PF6]), under an argon atmosphere. The resulting mixture was further stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction medium was extracted with diethyl ether (5 x 5 ml) and the resulting solution was evaporated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography using hexane/ diethyl ether 9:1 gave 1-phenylethanol tetrahydropyranyl ether as a yellow oil (263 mg, 78%).
