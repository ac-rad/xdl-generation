To a solution of the diacid (6.56 g, 26 mmol, 1 equiv) in methanol (200 mL) was added a catalytic amount of conc. H2SO4 (0.07 mL, 1.3 mmol, 5 mol%).  The mixture was set to reflux for 6 h after which it was allowed to cool to room temperature.  The methanol was removed in vacuo and the resulting oil washed with sat. NaHCO3 solution (20 mL).  The organics were extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo leaving a brown oil which was seen to be of sufficient purity for use in further reactions.  (6.32 g, 87%).
