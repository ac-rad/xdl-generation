A solution of 4-hydroxybenzaldhyde (2.0 g, 16.4 mmol), 4-nitrobenzyl bromide (3.54 g, 16.4 mmol), potassium carbonate (3.40 g, 24.6 mmol) in dry DMF (20 mL) was heated at 100â„ƒ for 3 h with constant stirring. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool, added to ice water and the resulting precipitate was isolated at the pump to give a yellow solid. The solid was washed three times with water (10 mL each time) to yield 4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)benzaldehyde (3.11 g, 74%) as a light yellow solid. [How was it dried?]
