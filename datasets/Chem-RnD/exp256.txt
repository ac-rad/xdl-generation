A mixture of ethyl acetoacetate (2 mmol), 5-methylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (2 mmol), urea (3 mmol) and magnesium bromide (0.2 mmol) was heated at 100 Â°C with stirring until the mixture turned to solid mass (45 min). After completion (monitored by TLC), the solid was cooled to room temperature and poured onto crushed ice (20 g) and stirred for 10 min. The crude product was filtered, washed with cold water (2x10 mL) and then recrystallized from ethanol or ethyl acetate/n-hexane to afford white crystals. Yield (494 mg, 88%)
