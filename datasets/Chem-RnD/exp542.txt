To a solution of ethyl 2-methylene-5-oxopentanoate (1.0 g, 6.40 mmol) in 1, 4 dioxane-H2O (1:1, 25 mL) was added DABCO (0.71 g, 6.40 mmol) and ethyl acrylate (2.05 mL, 19.21mmol) at 30 Î¿ C. Reaction mixture was stirred for 48 h and quenched by adding saturated NH4Cl solution. The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL), and ethyl acetate was evaporated to give crude product. Purification by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate = 9/1) gave the pure product as colourless oil (1.35 g, 82 %).
