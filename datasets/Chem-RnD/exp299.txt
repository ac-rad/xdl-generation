A solution of KH2PO4 (10 g) in water (200 cm3) was mechanically stirred in a 2L round bottom flask and ice (200 g) added. The flask was cooled in ice-ethanol mixture and (KSO3)2NO (6 g, 22.4 mmol) added followed by a solution of 4-(methylmercapto)phenol (1.0 g, 7.1 mmol) in diethyl ether (20 cm3). After 1 m the solution was orange and after 5 m dark red. After 1 h the mixture was rotoevaporated at 20 ºC to remove the diethyl ether and extracted with chloroform (3 x 50 cm3). Evaporation gave a crimson solid (0.95 g, 86% yield), m.p. 92 ºC.
