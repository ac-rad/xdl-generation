To a suspension of magnesium turnings (744 mg, 30.56 mmol, 2 equiv.) in specially dried diethyl ether (6 mL/mmol) with mercury(II) chloride (218 mg, 0.08 mmol, 0.5 %), was added propargyl bromide (4.3 mL of an 80 wt.% solution in toluene, 29.03 mmol, 1.9 equiv.) in small portions while heating the reaction mixture at reflux (Note: A small grain of iodine is generally required to promote formation of the Grignard reagent.).   The mixture was left to cool and stir at room temperature for 2 hours to give a cloudy light green solution.
The Grignard reagent was cooled to -78 ºC and a solution of the cyclopentenone (4.34 g, 15.28 mmol, 1 equiv.) in distilled diethyl ether (1 mL/mmol) was added.  The mixture was allowed to stir for 4 hours slowly warming to 0 ºC.  Subsequent quenching with saturated ammonium chloride solution (1 mL/mmol) was followed by extraction of the organic fraction with water (1.5 mL/mmol) and brine (1.5 mL/mmol).  Drying of the organic fraction over magnesium sulfate and solvent reduction in vacuo gave the crude oil which was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 10 : 1)  to give the product as a white crystalline solid (major isomer) and a clear and colourless oil (minor isomer) (4.43 g, 89 %, 19 : 1 mixture of isomers).
