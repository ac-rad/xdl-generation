Under a dinitrogen atmosphere, ethyl 3-(1-pyrenyl)propanoate (0.5 g, 1.6 mmol) was dissolved in warm ethanol (10 ml), then water (1 ml) and solid potassium hydroxide (0.18 g, 3.2 mmol) was added and the solution left stirring overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled and solvent removed under vacuo. Buffer solution (pH 2, 10 ml) was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 ml x 3). The combined organics were dried over Na2SO4 and solvent was removed in vacuo to yield orange crystalline solid (0.45 g, 99%)
