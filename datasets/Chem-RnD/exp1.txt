To a stirring solution of the maleimide and triphenylphosphine in THF at zero under nitrogen was added the alcohol in THF (10ml) and then DEAD dropwise. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and then left stirring for 2.5 hrs after which time the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resultant crude prduct was purified by flash column chromatography.
