To 2-nitrobenzyl chloride (5.05 g, 29.43 mmol) in EtOH (20 ml) was added slowly KOH (8.26 g, 148 mmol) in warm EtOH (50 ml) with vigorous stirring. The mixture became warm. The mixture was stirred overnight, and a yellow precipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with EtOH, and recrystallized from ethyl acetate, yielding 2,2’-dinitrostilbene as needle like yellow crystals (1.39 g, 17.5%).
