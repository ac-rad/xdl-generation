A solution of tin (IV) chloride (6 mL of a 1 M in dichloromethane, 5.6 mmol) was slowly added to a stirred solution of  6-acetoxy-2,3-dihydro-6H-pyrano-3-one (17.6 g, 0.113 mol) in dichloroethane (10 mL) and tert-butanol (53 mL, 0.55 mol).  Stirring was continued at ambient temperature for 5 h, after which, the reaction was quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (150 mL) and the resulting oil was extracted into ethyl acetate (500 mL).  The organics were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL) and water (40 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered under reduced pressure and concentrated in vacuo to yield an orange oil which, was purified by chromatography on silica with petrol: ethyl acetate (7:1 v:v) as the eluent to yield the title compound as a colourless liquid (17.1 g, 89 %).
