To a Schlenk vessel charged with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (6.6 g, 74.1 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) was added cyclohexyl isothiocyanate 4 (5.0 g, 35.4 mmol) in THF (10 mL).  The solution was then stirred overnight to yield an off-white precipitate.  The precipitate was then isolated by filtration and washed with cold chloroform.  Any residual solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure (yield 6.92 g, 85 %).
