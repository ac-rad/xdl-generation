The synthesis was performed using standard Schlenk techniques under a nitrogen atmosphere.  To a dried and nitrogen flushed glass microwave reaction vial was added  5-flouro-1-indanone (0.101 g, 0.67 mmol).  The vial's atmosphere was cycled four times. Morpholine (2.0 mL, 0.023 mol, 3.47 equivs.) was added, The reaction was then sealed and heated to 100 °C for 20 hours under variable watt microwave heating.  At the completion of the reaction the crude material was transferred to a 50 mL round bottom flask using 3.5 mL ethyl acetate. Silica and ethyl acetate (4.5 mL) were added to the flask and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a free flowing dry load.  The crude product was then subjected to purification via flash chromatography (75 : 25 ethyl acetate : hexanes) to yield a red solid (144 mg, 98.7%).  
 
We also ran a larger scale reaction (500 mg 1-indanone, 0.0033 mole) to test scale up.  We observed a reduced yield isolating 523 mg in a 73% yield.
