Toluene (50 mL) was added to a large Schlenk vessel charged with (+/-)-trans‑1,2‑diaminocyclohexane (1.0 g, 8.8 mmol), 2-bromo-6-methyl pyridine (3.0 g, 18 mmol), (±)-BINAP (218 mg, 0.35 mmol), [Pd2(dba)3] (160 mg, 0.18 mmol) and NaOBut (2.4 g, 25 mmol).  The resulting deep red/brown mixture was heated for 4 h at 80°C with stirring.  On cooling to room temperature diethyl ether (50 mL) was added.  The resultant yellow mixture was washed with brine (2 x 30 mL), dried over MgSO4 and the solvent removed by evaporation under reduced pressure.  The yellow product was recrystallised from pentane / diethyl ether (yield 1.72 g, 60 %).
