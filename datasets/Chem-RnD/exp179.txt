A solution of the sulfonyl chloride (1.0 g, 0.64 mL, 6.1 mmol) in THF (30 mL) or DCM (30 mL) was cooled to -15 °C under an inert atmosphere.  To this solution was added triethylamine (2.5 mL, 2.6 g, 25 mmol) dropwise so that the temperature did not rise above 0 °C.  A solution of pentafluorophenol (1.1 g, 6.1 mmol) in THF (10 mL) or DCM (10 mL) was added dropwise so that the temperature did not rise above 0 °C.  The mixture was allowed to stir for a further 20 minutes after which time the cooling bath was removed and the reaction allowed to warm to RT over 3h.  The reaction was diluted with DCM (30 mL) and washed with 2M HCl (3 x 30 mL), 2M sodium carbonate solution (3 x 30 mL) and water (2 x 30 mL).  The organic fraction was dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvent removed from the filtrate in vacuo.  The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (10% Ether/Petrol) to yield the PFP sulfonate ester as a yellow oil (0.99 g, 3.6 mmol, 59%)
