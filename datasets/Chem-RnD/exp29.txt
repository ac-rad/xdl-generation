The coumarin (4.5 g, 22 mmol), was dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 mL) and 5% palladium on charcoal (75 mg) was added. The resulting black suspension was purged with nitrogen (10 mins) then hydrogen (5 mins) and stirred vigorously in a hydrogen atmosphere for 16 hours. The mixture was purged with nitrogen (10 mins) then filtered through celite and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to yield the product as a clear oil (4.5 g, 21 mmol, 99%).
