To a stirred solution of 100.0 g (0.69 mol) of 8-hydroxyquinoline in 1500 mL of methanol, the solution of 5.0 g Na2WO4.2H2O (5% of catalyst based on the weight of  8-hydroxyquinoline) in 30 mL of water was added. Then 500 mL of 35% H2O2 (5.82 mol) was added with agitation at 20–25°C for 2 h. When the addition was complete the reaction was kept at ambient temperature until TLC analysis of a sample showed almost complete conversion of 8-hydroxyquinoline (approximately 54 h). Slightly yellow mixture was poured into 1000 mL of water. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 12–15 h and then at –30 °C for 7 h. Crystalline product was filtered off, washed with cold water (5 x 200 mL) and dried at 50 °C to give 99.5 g (89,6% yield) of 8-hydroxyquinoline-1-oxide with purity of 99,9% (UPLC) and melting point of 138–140 °C.
Concentration of the filtrate to 1100–1150 mL volume allowed to obtain an additional quantity of the crude product (5.2 g). Recrystallization from methanol provided 4.0 g of 8-hydroxyquinoline-1-oxide with UPLC purity 99,9%, mp 139–140 °C  .
