A 500 mL, three-necked round bottom flask was purged with N2. To the flask was added 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (250 mg, 4.668 mmol, 4 equiv), benzophenone (850.6 mg, 1.167 mmol, 4 equiv, 1.0 equiv per NH2 functionality), 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) (3.142 g, 28.008 mmol, 24 equiv) and chlorobenzene (100 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature under N2. Titanium (IV) chloride (7.002 mL, 7.002 mmol, 6 equiv, 1M in toluene) was syringed in portions over 15 minutes. After the addition, the mixture was stirred for another 20 min at room temperature. The flask was then equipped with a reflux condenser, and the reaction was stirred at 125 ºC for 72 hours. The reaction was then cooled to 40 ºC and vacuum filtered through a Buchner funnel equipped with filter paper. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was dry-loaded onto silica gel (~3x by mass, 750 mg) and purified using column chromatography using a Teledyne ISCO flash chromatograph system on a 12g column (50% chloroform in hexanes for 4 minutes to 100% chloroform for a remaining 11 minutes). Benzophenone eluted first, and the yellow/orange product eluted second. The product was verified by thin layer chromatography (Rf =0.12) using 100% chloroform and the fractions were concentrated to yield an orange solid (590 mg, 6.779 mmol, 29% yield).
