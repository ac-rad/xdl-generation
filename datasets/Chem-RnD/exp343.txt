To a 250 mL round bottom flask was added the trans-cinnamic acid, (37,04 g, 0.25 mol, 1 equiv.),  absolute ethanol1 (51.75 g, 1.125 mol, 4.5 equiv.) and benzene (50 mL, 5 M in trans-cinnamic acid ). The flask was equipped with a stirbar, a soxhlet with cellulose membrane insert (containing 25 g of MgSO4), and a reflux condenser. The flask was heated to ≈ 40 °C in oil bath and concentrated H2SO4 (2.56 mL, 0.0475mol, 0.19 equiv.) was added all at once via a syringe. The solution was heated to reflux (oil bath at 120 °C and allowed to stir overnight. The solution was then diluted with ether (≈100 mL). The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with 3 X 100 mL of a 10% w.t. sodium bicarbonate solution (CAUTION: CO2 gas is evolved). The organic layer was then washed with deionized water (≈100 mL), brine (≈100 mL), and dried with Na2SO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation to afford ethyl cinnamate as a clear yellow oil (38.49 g, 87%)2.
