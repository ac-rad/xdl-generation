A mixture of sodium hydride (6 g, 0.15 mol, 60 % dispersion in mineral oil, oil removed with petroleum ether), potassium carbonate (0.6 g, 0.004 mol), and S-allyl tetrahydrothiophenium bromide (31.35 g, 0.15 mol) in dry THF (80 mL) was stirred for 10 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to -10 Â°C, and cyclohexanone (5 g, 0.05 mol, 5.3 mL) added. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, and stirred overnight. The suspension was filtered, and the filtrate was diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL). The solution was washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in-vacuo. Purification by column chromatography over silica gel (eluting with 10:1 petroleum ether/DCM then with 3:1 petroleum ether/DCM) gave the product (4g, 0.029 mol, 60 %) as a yellow oil.
