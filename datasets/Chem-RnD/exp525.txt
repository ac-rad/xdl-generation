A two-necked round-bottomed flask was charged with 1,2-difluorobenzene (12.6 g, 10.9 mL) and a Teflon coated magnetic follower and then cooled to 0°C using an external ice bath. To the gently stirred and cooled solution, concentrated H2SO4 (40 mL) was added, followed by the slow addition (caution: highly exothermic reaction) of fuming (90%) HNO3 (100 mL) (Note A). A reflux condenser equipped with a scrubber (Note B) was fitted and the solution warmed slowly to ambient temperature and stirred for a further 2 hours. The reaction was heated slowly (caution: evolution of gaseous nitrogen oxides) over 2 hours to 100°C (Note C) and kept at this temperature for a further 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature (Note D) and then poured slowly onto vigorously stirred crushed ice (ca 500 g, Note E). The solid was collected via vacuum filtration (water aspirator) and subsequently washed with copious amounts of H2O (ca 500 mL) until the washings were no longer acidic. The solid was dried in vacuo (< 10-2 mbar for 10 hours) to obtain the product as an off-white microcrystalline solid (12.8 g, 56%).
