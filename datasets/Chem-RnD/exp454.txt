Cpâ€ HSiMe2Cl (1.01 g, 4.70 mmol) was charged into a Schlenk vessel and dissolved in THF (25 ml). tert-Butylamine (1.18 ml, 0.82 g, 11.0 mmol, 2.5 eq.) was added and the solution stirred overnight. The solvent and unreacted tert-butylamine were removed in vacuo. Pentane (20 ml) was added and the solution filtered via cannula. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give a yellow oil (1.24 g, 95 %).
