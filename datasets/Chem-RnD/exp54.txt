A mixture of (-) ephedrine hydrochloride (20.1 g, 0.1 mol,1 eq) and urea (18.1 g, 0.3 mol, 3 eq) was heated  at 180°C in an oil bath.  The two white solids melted to form a colourless melt and stirred for 45 minutes.  The temperature of the oil bath was raised to 215°C and stirred for a couple of hours to give an orange melt.  The reaction was cooled down and to which DCM was added slowly and then washed with distilled water.  The aqueous layer was washed with DCM and the organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered, reduced under pressure to afford an orange solid.  Purification by column chromatography is necessary eluting with 2:1 PE:EtOAc to afford the imidazolidinone as a white solid (9.6 g, 50 %).
