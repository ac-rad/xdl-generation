To a soution of tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenylcarbamate (A, 0.92g, 4.4mmol) in acetone (10 mL) was added potassium carbonate anhydrous (1.82g, 13.2mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature after which 1,2-dibromoethane (B, 2.48g, 1.14mL, 13.2mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was then heated at reflux for 12h after which acetone was evaporated and water was added to the residue. The aqueous layer was then extracted with ethyl acetate thrice (10 mL each). The organic washings were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Finally, the organic layer was dried in vacuo to afford solid residue which was purified on silica gel (100g, 60-120 mesh size) eluting with ethylacetate-hexane solvent system. The product was eluted with 2% ethylacetate as a white powder (C, 0.60g, 40%) while the unreacted starting material (A, 0.49g) was obtained with 6% ethylacetate.
