The synthesis was performed using standard Schlenk techniques under a nitrogen atmosphere. To a sealed roundbottom flask charged with 1-indanone (2.00 g, 0.0151 mol), anhydrous 2-MeTHF (76 mL) was added. Phenylmagnesium Bromide (5.4 mL, 0.0151 mol, 2.8 M solution in 2-MeTHF) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 40 °C for 20 h. The reaction mixture was quenched and washed with saturated ammonium chloride (3 x 15 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 15 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a roundbottom flask, and further eluted with diethyl ether (10 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Crude 1-phenyl-indanol was isolated. To the roundbottom flask charged with the crude mixture was added: iodine (383 mg, 1.51 mmol). The neat reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 20 h. TLC was used to monitor the reaction.* The reaction was quenched with aqueous sodium thiosulfate (10% aqueous, 3 x 15 mL) and diethyl ether (3 x 15 mL). The reaction mixture was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a roundbottom flask, and further eluted with diethyl ether (10 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding a tan oil. The product was then purified using flash chromatography (95:5 Hex:EtOAc) to yield a yellow oil, 3-phenyl-indene (1.88 g, 65%).    
*An aliquot was removed from the crude reaction mixture and diluted for TLC.
