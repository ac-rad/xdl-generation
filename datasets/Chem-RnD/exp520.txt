To a dried and nitrogen flushed 50 mL flask was added: 3-phenylindene (267 mg, 1.3 mmols) and anhydrous heptane (14 mL, 0.1 M). The reaction solution was cooled to 0 °C via an ice bath. After stirring for 10 minutes - n-BuLi (0.590 mL, 1.4 mmol) was added dropwise. The solution turns a pale yellow, with a slight turbidity developing within minutes. The reaction was allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight (16 h). The heptanes was removed under reduced pressure to yield a slightly yellow solid. The temperature was reduced to − 70 °C via a dry ice, ethyl acetate bath - THF (10 mL, anhydrous) was then added, the solution becomes a crimson red. To this solution is added, terephthaldehyde (96 mg, 0.65 mmol, dissolved in 4 mL anhydrous THF) dropwise. The reaction is allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight (16 hours).  The reaction is quenched with NH4Cl (10 mL, saturated, aqueous) and extracted with ethyl acetate (15 mL, 3X). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure.
A crude red solid is isolated and subjected to trituration (hexanes, 10 mL, 5X).  The desired product is isolated as a clean powdered red solid (199 mg, 58% yield).
