To a cooled (0 °C) solution of 3-methylcatechol (30.0 g, 0.24 mol) in ethyl acetoacetate (65 mL) was added sulfuric acid (98%, 270 mL) dropwise over a period of 2 hours so that the temperature did not rise above 15 °C. The deep red solution was allowed to stir at 0 °C for 2 hours after which time the mixture was poured onto ice (400 g) and extracted into ether (5 x 300 mL). The organic extracts were combined, dried (MgSO4), filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The crude solid was recrystalised from ethanol to yield the product as white needles (5.6 g, 29 mmol, 23%).
