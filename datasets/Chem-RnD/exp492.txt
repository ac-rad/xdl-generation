To a solution diisopropylamine (0.75 mL, 5.35 mmol, 2 equiv.) in THF (40 mL) at -40 °C was added n-butyllithium (2.1 M in hexane, 2.55 mL, 5.35 mmol, 2 equiv.). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0 °C and stirred for 5 minutes (Note 1). After cooling to -70 °C, methyl 2-methoxy-6-methylbenzoate (482 mg, 2.67 mmol, 1 equiv.) in THF (5.0 mL) was added and stirring was continued for 10 minutes at -70 °C (Note 2). The lactone (765 mg, 2.67 mmol, 1 equiv.) in THF (3.0 mL) was then added and the mixture was maintained at -70 °C for 30 minutes then allowed to warm to 0 °C over a period of 45 minutes (Note 3). The reaction was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride (20 mL), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 15 mL) and the combined organic layers were washed with brine (15 mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo. Flash column chromatography (silica gel using a graded solvent system, EtOAc-petrol, 1:4 to 1:1) gave two main fractions (Note 4). The first fraction (Rf 0.60 in EtOAc-petrol, 1:1) contained a mixture of unreacted benzoate and the naphthopyranone product. The second fraction (Rf 0.35 in EtOAc-petrol, 1:1) was identified as unchanged lactone (205 mg). The mixed fraction was further chromatographed (dichloromethane then dichloromethane-EtOAc, 19:1) (Note 5) to afford the benzoate (80 mg, Rf 0.55 in dichloromethane) and the naphthopyranone (414 mg, 39% [52% based on recovered lactone], Rf 0.15 in dichloromethane).
