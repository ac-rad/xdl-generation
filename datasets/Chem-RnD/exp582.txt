To a round-bottomed flask was charged 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone (3.00 g, 17.2 mmol) and thionyl chloride (30 mL, 413.4 mmol), the reaction mixture was heated to reflux with constant stirring for 22 hours*. Upon cooling the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness** and the dark yellow solid produced was washed with diethyl ether to yield 2-chloro-1,4-napthoquinone (2.84 g, 86%) as an orange solid.
