Fuming sulfuric acid (0.2 mL) was added to 0.8 mL freshly distilled acetic anhydride resulting in a vigorous exothermic reaction and the mixture becoming wine-red in color. This mixture was heated at 85-90 <sup>0</sup>C for 10 minutes. A solution of l-[2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-3,4- dimethoxybenzyl]-5,6-dimethoxyisoquinoline (25 mg in 1.0 mL) OfAc<sub>2</sub>O was added under nitrogen to the wine red sulfuric acid solution and the resulting mixture was heated at 85-90 <sup>0</sup>C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and methanol was added. The solution was then chilled and ether was added until a solid precipitated. The solid was then filtered off, washed with small amount of methanol and ether to furnish a yellowish solid in quantitative yield in high purity. <sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz) (MeOH-d^ Î´ 3.43 (s, 3H), 3.75 (s, 3H), 3.84 (s, 3H), 3.94 (s, 3H), 4.16 (s, 3H), 7.32 - 7.36 (m, IH), 7.42 - 7.45 (m, 2H), 7.47 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.56 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.68 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.85 - 7.93 (m, 4H), 8.74 (s, IH), 8.80 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, IH).
