Methanol (10 mL, see Author’s Note) was placed in a 50 mL round-bottom flask. 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (0.145 g, 1.0 mmol)  was added, followed by iodine (0.26 g, 1.0 mmol) and 2 drops of 7.2M sulfuric acid. The flask was fitted with an open-top water-cooled condenser and brought to reflux by heating with a mineral oil bath on a hot plate. 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (2 mL, 2 mmol)  were added in small portions over 5 min, and the mixture was refluxed for 4 h. The methanol was removed by rotary evaporation, and the solid residue taken up in approximately 10 mL of methylene chloride. This solution was shaken in a separatory funnel with aqueous sodium sulfite solution until the purple color of iodine was removed, dried over sodium sulfate and the solution gravity-filtered through a fluted paper. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to give 0.30 grams of a yellowish crystalline compound, 76% yield.
