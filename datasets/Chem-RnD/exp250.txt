An ice cold slurry of Na3[Co(CO3)3].3H2O (5.539 g, 0.015 mol), activated charcoal (4.121 g), and water (120 ml) was made in a 3 necked round bottom flask, whilst stirred. R,R-EDDS (4.392 g, 0.015 mol) was added slowly in small portions. The reaction mixture was allowed to be heated to room temperature, then to 80 Â°C. Acetic acid (5% aqueous, 14 ml) was added slowly in small portions, to ensure all CO2 evolution stopped. The hot solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, whilst being stirred. Using acetic acid (5% aqueous, the pH was adjusted to pH 4-4.3. The solution was filtered through Celite, and the volume of the filtrate reduced to approximately 30 ml. The addition of ethanol (150 ml) resulted in the precipitation of the purple product. The crude product was allowed to form overnight, and filtered the next day. The solid purple crystals were suspended in ethanol (100 ml). Water (60 ml) was added to dissolve the crystals. The solution was filtered, and ethanol was added to the solution until crystallisation began. The solution was heated to re-dissolve the crystals, and on cooling there was the formation of purple crystals. The fine purple crystals were filtered under vacuum and collected. Yield:  3.068 g, 53%
