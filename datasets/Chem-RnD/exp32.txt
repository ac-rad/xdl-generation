Hydrazine hydrate (12.1 mL, 0.25 mol, 2.5 equiv) was added dropwise to a solution of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (22.2 g, 0.1 mol, 1 equiv) in THF (100 mL) at -30°C under an inert atmosphere.  After stirring at -30°C for 30 minutes, ice-cold ethyl acetate (200 mL) was added to the cold reaction mixture and the mixture was washed repeatedly with ice-cold 10%aqueous sodium chloride (5x150 mL).  The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate at 0°C then was added slowly to a stirring solution of hexanes(1.2 L) over 5 minutes.  2-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazide precipitated as a white solid and was collected by vacuum filtration.  The filter cake was washed with hexanes (2x50 mL) and then dried in vacuo yielding the title compound as a white solid (17.61 g, 81 %)
