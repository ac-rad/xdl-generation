The palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine), diethylamine and vinyl halide are stirred together at room temperature for 15 minutes.  The copper iodide is then added, followed by the alkyne.  The solution is heated for 3-5 hours (TLC) at reflux, during which time it will usually go brown.  The reaction is quenched with ammonium chloride, extracted with ether, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered, concentrated and purified by column chromatography.
