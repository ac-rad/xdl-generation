4-Chlorobenzene-1-carbohydrazide (15g, 0.088M) was dissolved in carbon disulphide (5.8ml, 0.097M) and alcoholic KOH (7.4g, 0.132M, KOH in 15ml ethanol) was added drop wise to at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer for 6 hrs and monitored using thin layer chromatography (15:85; methanol:benzene). Filtration afforded Nâ€™-(4-chloro-benzoyl)hydrazine carbodithio potassium salt as yellow crystals. Yield: 22g, 87.85%.
