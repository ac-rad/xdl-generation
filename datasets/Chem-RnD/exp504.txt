In a 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar was added (chloromethyl)dimethyl(phenyl)silane (20.13 g, 0.108 mol, 1 equiv), acetone (100 mL, 1.08 M) and sodium iodide (28.4 g, 0.189 mol, 1.75 equiv) and allowed to reflux for 24 h. After this time, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the solvent removed via rotary evaporation to give a slurry. The resulting slurry was passed through a pad of CeliteÂ® which was washed with 100 mL of hexanes. The solvent removed via rotary evaporation to give the pure iodide as a clear, colorless liquid (30.1 g, 100%).
