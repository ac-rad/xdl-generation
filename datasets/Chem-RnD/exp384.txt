To an anhydrous 0.5 M THF solution of potassium diphenylphosphide (45.0 mL, 22.5 mmol) at RT, was added 1,2-difluorobenzene (1.97 mL, 20.0 mmol) and anhydrous N2 saturated PhMe (50.0 mL). The resulting solution was heated to reflux (110 °C) for 5 h, by which time the dark red colour of the phosphide had dissipated, and 19F NMR spectroscopy showed a single environment (δF: -103.3, d, JFP = 53.0 Hz) correlating to a monophosphine species.§ To the solution at RT, was added an anhydrous 0.5 M THF solution of potassium diphenylphosphide (45.0 mL, 22.5 mmol) and left to reflux (110 °C) for 15 h. P NMR spectroscopy revealed a single peak (δp: -12.3) and the red/orange reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was suspended in PhMe (200 mL) at 70 °C, and activated charcoal (≈ 5.0 g) was added, whilst vigorous stirring occurred. The mixture was hot vacuum filtered through Celite and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude material was recrystallised (PhMe) to afford 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene  (87%, 7.80 g) as a colourless solid. §No peak observed for 1,2-difluorobenzene  (δF: -138.7). P NMR spectrum showed concurrent data (δP: -18.0, d, JPF = 53.0 Hz).
