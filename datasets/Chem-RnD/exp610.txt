General procedure: A mixture of 5,6-dibromopyridin-2-amine (80 g, 318 mmol), ethynylbenzene (78 ml, 698 mmol), copper(I) iodide (1.51 g, 7.94 mmol), Dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium(II) (5.79 g, 7.94 mmol) and triethylamine (110 ml, 794 mmol) is stirred under argon atmosphere in ACN (500 ml) with THF (250 ml) for 21 h at 50Â°C. The mixture is diluted with water and extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers are dried over MgS0<sub>4</sub>, concentrated in vacuo and the product purified by NP chromatography. Yield: 82 g (94percent). HPLC-MS: M+H=273/275; tR=1.34 min (*Method_l).
