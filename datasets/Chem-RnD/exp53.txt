Dissolve Lawessons reagent (580 mg, 1.43 mmoles) in THF (120 ml) and add THF (50 ml)  solution of the amide (500 mg, 2.86 mmoles) to this reagent at room temperature. Stir at room temperature until reaction is complete by tlc (in this case 30 minutes but you can leave the reaction overnight if more convenient). Evaporate solvent and then carry out a standard aqueous work-up using water and extraction with ether. Purification by silica-gl chromatography (petroleum ether: ether gradient, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1) to give the  product. Yield 472 mg, 86%.
