A 200 ml round bottom one neck flask equipped with a heating mantle and magnetic stirrer Â was charged with ethanol (60 ml, 95%). Stirring was commenced and potassium hydroxide pellets (4 g) were added slowly over ~ 15 min and the mixture further stirred until all pellets had dissolved. 4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)-benzonitrile (3.09g, 12 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred until homogeneous. The solution was then diluted with distilled or deionized water (20 ml), two silicon carbide boiling stones added, and a water condenser attached. Heating was commenced and the solution taken to full reflux for ~12 h (overnight). During this period a copious white precipitate of amide separated from the solution. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate collected on a Buchner funnel by suction filtration. The walls of the flask were washed water (2 x 10 ml) which were in turn filtered with the Buchner funnel. Boiling stones and stirring bar were mechanically removed with a spatula. The white solid was transferred to a large watch glass and air dried overnight yielding the amide (2.9 g, 88%). The material required no further purification.
