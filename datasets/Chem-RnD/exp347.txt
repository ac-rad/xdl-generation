In an Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a stopper, are successively placed furfuraldehyde (21.5 mL; 259.5 mmol), ethanol (20 mL), 2,3-butanedione (11,4 mL; 130.4 mmol) and 4 drops of piperidine. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 7 d protected from light. The resulting orange precipitate is filtered, washed with cold ethanol until washings are clear and dried under vacuum over P2O5. Yield: 1.96 g (6.2%).
