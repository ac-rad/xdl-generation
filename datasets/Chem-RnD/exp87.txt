Formic acid (25 ml, 0.663 moles) was added to amine (800 mg, 7.2 mmoles) and stirred at room temperature for a few minutes. Acetic anhydride (7.5 ml, 29.5 mmoles) then added and heated at 80 Â°C for ten minutes. This process was repeated until reaction complete (in this case, 40 minutes). The mixture cooled and solvent removed. Purification by chromatography (ether then ethyl acetate). Yield (564 mg, 57%).
