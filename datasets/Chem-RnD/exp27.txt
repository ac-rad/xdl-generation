To a cooled solution (-20°C) of triphenyl phosphine (532 mg, 2 mmol, 1.3 equiv) in THF (6 mL) was added DEAD (353 mg, 2 mmol, 1.3 equiv).  After 10 minutes a solution of 3-trimethylsilylpropyn-1-ol (200 mg, 1.56 mmol, 1 equiv) in THF (5 mL) was added and stirring continued for a further 10 minutes at -20°C.  A solution of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazide (440 mg, 2 mmol, 1.3 equiv) in THF (6 mL) was added and stirring was continued at -20°C for 90 minutes.  The reaction vessel was warmed to room temperature and stirring continued for 16 hours.  The solvent was removed in vacuo (cold bath) and the yellow oil produced was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with petrol:ether (3:1 v:v) as the eluent yielding the title compound as a clear, colourless oil (126 mg, 73%)
