2,6-bis[1-(2-isopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine page 436 (0.50 g, 1.04 mmol) and Fe4Cl8.THF6 (0.24 g, 0.52 mmol, 0.5 eq.) were charged into a Schlenk vessel under argon. DCM (30 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, after which time the solution had become dark blue. The solution was filtered via cannula into a clean Schlenk vessel, and concentrated to ca 20 ml. Diethyl ether (60 ml) was added, and a blue precipitate formed. This was collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether (20 ml) and dried in vacuo. (0.51 g, 82 %).
