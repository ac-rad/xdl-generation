To a solution of 2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-methyl-3,4-dihydro-naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester (2.22 g, 9.0 mmol, 1 equiv) in DCM (115 mL)cooled to 0 °C was added bromotrichloromethane (1.95 g, 9.9 mmol, 1.1 equiv) and DBU (1.40 g, 11 mmol, 1.2 equiv) dropwise.  The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 17 h.  The resulting yellow solutionwas quenched with NH4Cl solution (25 mL) and extracted into DCM (2 x 50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  Purification was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with P:EA (9:1 v:v) as the eluent to yield the title compound as a white solid. (2.0 g, 90%)
