Pyridine-2,6-dicarbonyl dichloride (2.04 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (50 ml). (R)-(+)-a-methylbenzylamine (2.42g, 2.54 ml, 20mmol) and dry triethylamine (2.02g, 2.8 ml, 20mmol) were added dropwise and the solution was stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then washed with water (3Ã—50 ml) and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the obtained solid was recrystallised from DCM/pentane. Yield 2.7 g (72%).
