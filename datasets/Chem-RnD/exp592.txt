EXAMPLE 7 <br/>The procedure of Example 6 is repeated except that 121.7 g (450 mmol) of diethyl 2-(p-chlorophenyl)malonate is used. <br/>A 130.9 g amount of diethyl 2-chloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)malonate (purity: &gt;98percent) is obtained, which is equivalent to a yield of 95.4percent of theory. <br/>
