To a suspension of the alcohol (D-fucose) (6.11 mmol) in acetic anhydride (35 mL, 37.41 g, 36.64 mmol, 6 equiv.) was added a catalytic amount of pyridine (1.0 mL, 0.97 g, 12.21 mmol, 0.2 equiv.).  Additional sugar (54.96 mmol) was added to the resulting white suspension in portions keeping the internal temperature between 30 and 40 Â°C (if necessary by cooling in a cold water or ice-bath).  After addition was complete the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature.  After 24 hours, when the reaction mixture had turned clear and colourless, dichloromethane (250 mL) was added, followed by extraction with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (2 x 100 mL), water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL).  The organic fraction was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed in vacuo to give the crude product consisting of both anomers of the protected sugar (20.2 g, > 99 %, beta : alpha (2 : 1)).  Separation of the 2 anomers can be achieved by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 5 : 1).
