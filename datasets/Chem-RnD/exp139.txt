A suspension of methyl indole-3-carboxylate (2.00 g, 11.4 mmol) in dichloromethane (25 ml) was cooled to 0 0C under nitrogen and treated sequentially with 1,4-dimethylpiperazine (731 mg, 6.4 mmol) and N-chlorosuccinimide (1.68 g, 12.6 mmol). The resulting solution was stirred for 2 h at 0 0C and subsequently added via cannula to a solution of allyl alcohol (1.30 g, 1.90 ml, 22.8 mmol) and trichloroacetic acid (448 mg, 2.7 mmol) in dichloromethane (15 ml) maintaining the temperature below 25 0C. After 2 h the reaction mixture was washed with 10 % aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 x 25 ml) then with 0.5 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (25 ml) and finally with water (25 ml). The resulting solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to leave a brown oil. The oil was redissolved in toluene and stirred for 20 h in the presence of silica gel at ambient temperature. The slurry was filtered, evaporated under reduced pressure and the product isolated by column chromatography (40% ethyl acetate:hexane) to give the oxindole as a colourless solid (1.87 g, 71%).
