Potassium bromate (15.2 g, 91 mmol, 1 equiv) was added over a 30 minute period to a vigorously stirred solution of 2-iodobenzoic acid (17.2 g, 69 mmol, 0.75 equiv) and 14.6 mL of 0.73 M H2SO4. The temperature of the reaction was maintained below 55 °C by the aid of an ice bath. The resulting mixture was warmed to 65 °C and stirred for 4 h. The slurry was cooled to 0°C, filtered and washed with water (200 mL), ethanol (2 x 20 mL) and dry ether (3 x 20 mL) leaving a slightly pink solid. To a stirring solution of the pink solid [1-hydroxy-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one] (20g, 71 mmol, 1 equiv) in acetic anhydride (80 mL, 286 mmol, 4 equiv) was added TsOH.H2O (100 mg). The flask was equipped with a drying tube and was heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 2 h. The resulting brown slurry was cooled to 0 °C in ice-water and filtered thruogh a fritted glass funnel. The resulting white solid was washed with anhydrous ether (5x50 mL) resulting in a white crystalline solid (15.2 g, 40 %)
