2-hydroxymethyl-1,3,4-trimethoxyanthraquinone (1.39 g, 4.22 mmol) was dissolved in benzene (100 cm3) and water (50 cm3) added, tetrabutylammonium chloride (360 mg) was added, followed by powdered KMnO4 (1 g, 6.3 mmol) and finally KOH (2.8 g).   The mixture was stirred for 3 d then the phases were separated and the organic phase extracted with water (25 cm3). The combined aqueous phases were stirred and cooled, adding Na2SO3 (3 g) and H2SO4 to acidify. The bright lemon yellow precipitate of 1,3,4-trimethoxy-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydro-anthracene-2-carboxylic acid was filtered and dried to give 1.20 g (83% yield).
