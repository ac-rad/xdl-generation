In a dry 100 mL round bottom flask containing the 2-benzylidene-tetrahydropyran-3-one (0.307 g, 1.18 mmol) and fitted with a septum was added dry tetrahydrofuran (32 mL) via syringe under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was cooled to 0° C by placing the flask on an ice bath. Cold vinyl magnesium bromide (14.75 mL, 11.8 mmol) was added dropwise to the mixture with stirring at 0° C. The reaction slowly warmed to room temperature and was allowed to stirred overnight at rt. After, the reaction was once again placed on an ice bath and cooled to 0° C. The septum was removed and the reaction was quenched by the dropwise addition of ice cold water (5 mL). The mixture was then added to a separatory funnel to which was added an additional 10 mL water. After shaking, the ether layer was set aside and the aqueous layer was extracted with additional ether (2 x 10 mL). The combined ether layers were dried with Na2SO4 and then filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the syrupy residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 7:3 hexanes:ethyl acetate as eluent to give the vinyl addition product 0.257 g (88%) as a clear, colorless oil.
