A mixture of 0.1 mol of 4-aminobenzonitrile and 0.2 mol of potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) in 100 ml glacial acetic acid was cooled in an ice bath and stirred for 10-20 min, and then 0.1 mol of bromine in glacial acetic acid was added drop wise at such a rate to keep the temperature below 10 Â°C throughout the addition. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2-4 h, the hydrobromide (HBr) salt thus separated out. In the reaction mixture 150 ml water was added. The solid 4-cyano-2-thiocyanatoaniline thus obtained was filtered, dried and recrystallized from ethanol. Then in 0.05 mol of this intermediate, 10 mL of concentrated HCl and 20 mL of water was added and the mixture was refluxed for 2 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by Thin Layer Chromatography using toluene: acetone (9:1) solvent system. After the completion of the reaction, the solution was cooled and the product was filtered, washed with water, and recrystallized from ethanol to give 3g[39].
