A J. Young’s flask protected from light was charged with [M(PR3)2(CO)Cl] (ca. 100 mg, 1.0 eq.) and AgOTf (1.1 eq.). A solution of pyridine or 3-chloropyridine (5 eq.) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The solution was filtered to remove precipitated AgCl salts and the solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting yellow solid was washed with pentane (2 × 3 mL) and then recrystallized by slow diffusion of pentane into a CH2Cl2 solution of the compound.
