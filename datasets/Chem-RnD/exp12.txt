The reagents are mixed together at 0°C (DCC added last), and stirred for six hours at this temperature. (It is not crucial to keep temp at 0°C constantly - reaction can be left to stir overnight. However best results are obtained if mixture is cooled prior to filtering: No DCU impurity is obtained.) The mixture is filtered to remove the DCU by-product, and the mixture is concentrated. Best results are obtained when this is done slowly without heating - crystallisation is easier. Purification is by recrystallisation (DCM/hexane or toluene/hexane) or column chromatography (PE/EtOAc or PE/DCM).
