The carbohdrate (3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-1-bromide) (52.0 mg, 0.13 mmol, 1 equiv.) was suspended in distilled ethanol (1.3 mL) and O-ethyl-S-potassium-dithiocarbonate (38.0 mg, 0.24 mmol, 1.8 equiv.) was added to give a yellow suspension (under nitrogen).  The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 15 hours (protected from light).  It was then diluted with chloroform (25 mL) and washed with a little water (2 x 5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (5 mL).  Drying over sodium sulfate and solvent removal in vacuo gave the crude product which was purified by flash column chromatography (toluene/ethyl acetate, 10 : 1) to yield the desired product as a pale yellow oil (40.3 mg, 70 %).
