To a solution of methyl-3, 3-dimethylacrylate (2.0 g, 18 mmol), in chloroform (30 mL), was added N-bromosuccinimide (3.6 g, 20 mmol) and AIBN (50 mg, 0.3 mmol). The mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours after which time excess NBS and succinimide was removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting red oil purified by colum chromatography (20% ether / petrol) to yield the brominated product as an inseparable mixture of cis and trans isomers (2.4 g, 12.5 mmol, 69%).
