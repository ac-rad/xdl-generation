To a solution of 3,5-dimethylanisole (26mL, 183.8mmol) in CCl4 (300mL), cooled to 0°C was added a solution of bromine (9.4mL, 183.8mmol) in CCl4 (150mL) over three hours by the aid of an addition funnel. The reaction mixture was stirred for a further 1/2 h at 0°C. The resulting orange/brown solution was quenched by addition of 3% NaOH solution (500mL). The organic layer was isolated and dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield a slightly yellow oil (39.5g, 100%).
