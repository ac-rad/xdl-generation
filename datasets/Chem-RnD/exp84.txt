To a solution of TMS-alkyne (14.86g, 31.52mmol) in methanol (250ml) was added potassium carbonate (0.54g, 3.9mmol) and the mixture stirred for 2hrs at room temperature under N2.  The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo, and the residue diluted with ether, washed with water, brine and dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  Purification by flash chromatography eluting with 25:1 petrol/ether yielded the title copmound as an orange solid (10.26g, 82%)
