A solution of HCl (10 ml, 4 M) was added to a solution of (R)-2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-2-phenylethyl methanesulfonate (2.5 g, 7.9 mmol) in dioxane (10 ml) and was stirred for 1 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was recrystallised from acetonitrile/diethyl ether. Yield 1.28 g (65%).
