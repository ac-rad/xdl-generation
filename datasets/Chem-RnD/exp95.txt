Benzhydrol (0.2g, 1.11mmol) and cholesteryl chloroformate (0.5g, 1.11mmol) were placed in an oven dried 3-necked flask and stirred in anhydrous toluene (15ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Pyridine  (0.1ml, 1.34mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction was stirred overnight and upon completion the reaction mixture was poured onto water (100ml) and extracted with DCM (3 x 100ml). The combined organics layers were washed with brine (100ml), dried over MgSO4, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude white solid was purified by flash column chromatography (5% EtOAc/hexane) to afford the desired product as a white crystalline solid (0.47g, 71%)
