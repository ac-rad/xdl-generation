To a solution of 2.53 g chlorobenzenesulfonamide in 20 ml dimethylformamide was added 0.50 g sodium hydride 55percent in oil and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. To the resulting solution was added a solution of 1.0 g hexamethylenediisocyanate in 10 ml dimethylformamide and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours. To the resulting solution was added 1.0 ml methanol. The solvents were removed by distillation under high vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 100 ml water and extracted with 50 ml ethyl acetate (twice). The pH of the aqueous phase was acidified from ca 9 to 1.2 by addition of 1 N hydrochloric acid. The solid was collected by filtration washed with water recrystallized from methanol and dried to constant weight under high vacuum to yield 2.57 g of the title compound as white crystals melting at 193-195Â° C.
