To a solution of the alcohol (500 mg, 1.77 mmol, 1 equiv.) in distilled tetrahydrofuran (8 mL) was added distilled triethylamine (828 mL, 580 mg, 5.31 mmol, 3 equiv.) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (216 mg, 1.77 mmol, 1 equiv.) at 0 ÂºC and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes before dropwise addition of methanesulfonyl chloride (206 mL, 304 mg, 12.65 mmol, 1.5 equiv.).  The resulting white suspension was left to slowly warm to room temperature while stirring for 3 hours and 30 minutes.  Quenching of the light brown suspension with water (5 mL) was followed by extraction with diethyl ether (3 x 10 mL).  The combined organic fractions were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent reduced in vacuo.  The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 20 : 1) to yield the desired product as a pale yellow oil (238 mg, 51 %).
