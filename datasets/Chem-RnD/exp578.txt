To a round-bottomed flask was added 2-nitro-9H-thioxanthen-​9-​one (1.00 g, 3.81 mmol) and acetic acid, (14 mL) and the suspension was allowed to stir for 5 minutes. To the reaction mixture was added a solution of anhydrous tin(II) chloride, 4.20g, (22.15 mmol) dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid (6mL).  The reaction mixture was heated to 100°C for 3 hours.*  Upon cooling a dark yellow solid was isolated by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel and then transferred to a conical flask.  To the conical flask was added an aqueous solution of 2.5M sodium hydroxide (50 mL)** and the suspension was heated to boiling for 15 minutes.  Upon cooling, the crude solid was isolated by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel and washed with acetic acid (20 mL).  The compound was recrystallized from propan-2-ol to yield 2-amino-thioxanthen-9-one (0.56 g, 63%) as bright-orange needles.
