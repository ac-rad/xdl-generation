In a 1 liter three neck flask,  equipped with mechanical stirrer, Y tube, dropping funnel, nitrogen inlet,  and  Friedrich water condenser,  were placed   300 ml of dry ether and  34 g (1.4 mole) of magnesium turnings while maintaining the system under dry nitrogen.  A crystal of iodine was added to initiate Grignard activation,  followed by a solution of 54 g  (0.7 mole) of redistilled allyl chloride in 100 ml ether, which was added dropwise, with stirring,  over a period of two hours.   During the course of the addition a thick white Grignard complex precipitated which was redissolved by addition of 1 ml dry tetrahydrofuran. After the addition was complete, the flask was immersed in a dry ice/ acetone bath at -25° to -30°. Then 11 g (0.2 mole) of freshly prepared proynal in 100 ml ether  was added, dropwise, over a period of one hour, while the bath temperature was maintained as above.  After the addition the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was decomposed by pouring over a slurry of 500g ammonium chloride and 500 g ice in a two liter beaker.  The ether and aqueous layer were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with 50 ml ether portions.   The combined ether extracts were shaken with 20 ml of water and then were dried over 25 g anhydrous  magnesium sulfate for one hour. The ether solution was decanted off into a one liter beaker. Removal of the ether on a steam bath yielded a light yellow oil.   The oil was distilled, under aspirator pressure, in an oil bath, 35 mm pressure,  bath temperature ~100 °and   the fraction boiling at 67-69° , (35 mm) was collected and appeared to be homogeneous by gas chromatography, 5-ft-SE-30 column, 100 °.column temperature.The yield of 5-hexen-1-yn-3-ol was  11 g  (57% based upon the  amount of propynal used). Other runs gave yields typically in the 50-60% range.
