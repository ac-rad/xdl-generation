Tri-n-butyltin hydride (TBTH, 0.8 ml, 2.97 mmoles) was added dropwise to a stirred refluxing solution of the diester (0.5g, 2.35 mmoles) AIBN (0.02g, 0.12 mmoles) in benzene (100 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux overnight and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give the crude product. Purification was carried out using silica-gel chromatography using petrol: ether (10:1) as eluent to give the product  as an inseparable mixture of isomers as an oil (1.145g, 97%).
