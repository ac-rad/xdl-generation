A mixture of thioxanthen-9-one (1 g, 4.7 mmol), isopropyl alcohol* (40 mL) and THF (20 mL) was heated to reflux with constant stirring**. Upon a clear solution being obtained***, NaBH4 (1.4 g, 18.5 mmol) was added in small portions carefully, and the reaction was left to stir at reflux for 3 hours. Upon cooling, the solution poured over ice (250 g) and the reaction mixture was stirred at speed until a white solid was produced****. The solid was isolated and dried at the pump under vacuum filtration***** to yield thioxanthen-9-ol (0.77 g, 76%) as a white solid.
