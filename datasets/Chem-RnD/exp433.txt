To 3-tert­-butyl,5-methoxysalicylic acid (1.90 g, 8.05 mmol) in a Schlenk vessel was added PPh3 (8.45 g, 32 mmol), and the atmosphere in the vessel replaced with argon. Acetonitrile (~25 ml), and then triethylamine (4.25 ml, 42 mmol) were added, with stirring. 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (0.79 g, 8.9 mmol) was injected in a small volume of acetonitrile. CCl4 (7.7 ml) was added dropwise over 4 hours. The mixture was stirred for 48 hours, after which time the solution was filtered, washed through with a little Et2O, which caused a further precipitation, this precipitate was also removed by filtration. The solvents were removed in vacuo, and the product extracted with hexane (3 × 100 ml). The combined extracts were dried in vacuo, and the pale yellow powder was purified by flash chromatography on a silica column, eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate (50:1), affording HL15 as a pale yellow crystalline solid (1.2 g, 54%) after removal of solvent.
