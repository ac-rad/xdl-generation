To a solution of C6H5CH2MgCl (100 ml, 1M in diethyl ether, 4 equiv.) in diethyl ether (100 ml) at -15°C was added a solution of TiCl4 (2.5 ml, 22.8 mmol) in pentane (100 ml) dropwise over 2 hours. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at -15°C and filtered through celite. The solid residue was washed with diethyl ether (2 x 50 ml) and the combined filtrate and washings were reduced in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in pentane (50 ml) and filtered followed by further washing of the residue with pentane (2 x 50 ml). The filtrate and pentane washings were combined and concentrated (ca. 70 ml) and cooled to        -30°C overnight to yield a dark red crystalline product. Yield 50-60 %
