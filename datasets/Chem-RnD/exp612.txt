Example 3 Preparation of AgF supported on CaF<sub>2 </sub>(AgF-CaF<sub>2</sub>). Silver fluoride was supported on calcium fluoride by slowly evaporating a mixture of silver carbonate (3.75 g) dissolved in water (5 mL), 48percent aqueous HF (1.2 g, 1.2 mL) and calcium fluoride (15 g) to dryness in a 45 mL plastic vial at 50Â° C. in the dark for 2 hours. The reagent was further dried on freeze dryer for 15 hours to remove any traces of water. The final reagent was a brown free-flow granular powder, highly hygroscopic and light sensitive.1 g of AgF-CaF2 was activated by heating at 40Â° C. under vacuum in a round bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar for 30 minutes, to which a solution of Salinosporamide A (250 mg, 0.8 mmol dissolved in 25 mL of dry CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) was added and stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. The solvent was removed under reduce pressure and the resulting residue was purified by silica flash using a solvent gradient of 50percent EtOAc/hexanes, 75percent EtOAc/Hexane, 100percent EtOAc, 20percent methanol/EtOAc and 40percent methanol/EtOAc. Compound 3 was eluted in 20-40percent methanol/EtOAc fractions as a pure compound (83 mg, 35percent yield). ESIMS, m/z 296 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>.
