A 5-litre flask was charged with (i) a solution of chloral hydrate (45 g, 0.27 mol) and Na2SO4.10H2O (320 g) in water (600 cm3), warmed 30 °C to dissolve the solids, (ii) 3-bromoaniline (43 g, 0.25 mol) dissolved with warming in water (150 cm3) and conc HCl (25 cm3) and (iii) a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (55 g, 0.79 mol) in water (250 cm3). A thick white suspension formed. The mixture was heated. At 60 – 70 °C a thick paste formed. After heating for 2 h at 80 – 100 °C the mixture was cooled to 80 °C and filtered. The filtrate yielded more solid (2.4 g) after cooling. The pale brown product (3-bromoisonitrosoacetanilide) was washed by stirring with water (400 cm3) followed by filtration. Drying in air for 2 d gave the product (81.2 g). The expected yield was 61 g, so still wet.
With mechanical stirring, conc H2SO4 (200 cm3) was heated to 60 °C in a flask which was then removed from the heating mantle. 3-bromoisonitrosoacetanilide (15 g) was added over 20 m in portions so that the temperature remained between 60 and 65 °C. The mixture was then heated to 80 °C, then cooled to 70 °C and poured on to crushed ice (2.5 litres). After standing 1 h, the orange precipitate was filtered and washed with water (2 x 60 cm3), drying at 40 °C to give the mixture of 4-bromo- and 6-bromo-isatin as a pale orange powder (8.9 g).Some of the bromoisatin mixture (10.5 g) was dissolved in hot (60 °C) NaOH solution (2M, 35 cm3) to give a dark brown solution. This solution was acidified with acetic acid (3.6 cm3) and the resulting orange-brown crystals filtered and washed with hot water to give 4-bromoisatin (5.7 g). The combined filtrates were warmed to 80 °C and conc HCl (5 cm3) added. After cooling overnight in a fridge, the bright orange crystals were filtered to give 6-bromoisatin (3.3 g).
