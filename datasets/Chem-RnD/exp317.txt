In a three-necked round bottomed flask fitted with an argon inlet and an addition funnel are placed powdered potassium hydroxide (10.00 g) and DMSO (30 ml). Under argon, a solution of pyrrole (5.13 g) in DMSO (12.5 ml) is added dropwise over 20 min. The resulting mixture is stirred at rt under argon for 30 min. 1-Bromoundecane (20.58 g) is then added dropwise over 15 min and the reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 15 h. The solution is poured onto 500 ml distilled water. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3×100 ml). Organic layers are combined, washed with water (3×100 ml), dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. The crude product is purified by column chromatography over silica (Petroleum ether/Diethyl ether 99:1 v/v). Pure N-undecylpyrrole is obtained as a colorless oil (13.96 g ; 81 %).
