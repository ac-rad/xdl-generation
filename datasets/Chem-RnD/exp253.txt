N’-(4-Chloro-benzoyl)-hydrazine carbodithio potassium salt (10 g, 3.5 mmol) was refluxed with hydrazine hydrate 98% (1.5 g, 3.0 mmol) for 8 h. Reaction was monitored for completion using tlc (15:85 methanol:benzene). The reaction mixture was poured into 50 ml of ice-cold water and acidified to pH 2-3 using 8-10 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Brown crystalline 4-amino-3-(4’-Chlorophenyl)-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole thus obtained was recrystallised by heating in 25 ml of ethanol to 78º C giving a clear solution, then cooling to 0 ºC. Light brown crystals were isolated by filtration.Yield: 6.5g, 82%.
