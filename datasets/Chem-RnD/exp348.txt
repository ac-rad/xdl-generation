Ethyl 3-(1-pyrenyl)acrylate (3.02 g, 10.1 mmol) was firstly dissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml). Ethanol (70 ml) and the 10% Pd/C (2 mol%) were then added to the mixture and the air evacuated out the system and replaced with hydrogen. The reaction was left to stir under a hydrogen baloon at room temperature for 29 hours. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a pad of celite with ethyl acetate and the solvent removed under vacuo to yield a dark yellow solid (3.02 g, 99%).
