To a round-bottomed flask* charged with 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (0.24 g, 1 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (20 mL) was slowly added a warm** solution of anhydrous tin (II) chloride (2.14, 11.29 mmol) in conc. hydrochloric acid (11 mL).  The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 24 hours with constant stirring.  The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and slowly poured over ice water to yield a yellow solid.  The solid was isolated by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel to yield 1,8-dihydroxyanthrone (0.20g, 88%) as a yellow solid.
