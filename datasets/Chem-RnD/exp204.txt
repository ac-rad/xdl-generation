Zinc (4 g, 61.9 mmol) was added to HCl (5%, 50 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes (hydrogen evolution). The liquid was decanted and the metal washed with distilled water (2 x 25 mL) followed by ethanol (20 mL). The hence activated zinc was added, in one portion, to a suspension of 2-cyano-3-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)acrylamide Page 236 (1.2 g, 4.32 mmol), ethanol (15 mL), HCOOH (85%, 15 mL) and ammonium formate (0.3 g, 4.76 mmol). The bright-yellow mixture was refluxed for 4 h and then allowed to stir over weekend at room temperature. After this time a thick, pale-yellow paste was obtained. Enough ethanol was added so that the mixture could be vacuum filtered; dark-brown filtrate was discarded. While under vacuum, the yellow filter cake was treated with 98% HCOOH until it finally became white and gray (only unreacted zinc and its salts remaining). Yellow filtrate, containing the product, was first treated with equal volume ice-cold water, and then basified with 10 % NaOH until yellow percipitate apeared. The solid was filtered, washed with cold i-PrOH and dried in oven to give 0.39 g (43.5 %) 2-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinoline-3-carboxamide as mat yellow crystals, m.p: 260-261?C, (decomp.).
