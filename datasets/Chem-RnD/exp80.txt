To a stirred solution of the substrate bromide (46 mg, 0.117 mmoles) in benzene (4 ml) was added TBTH (0.065 ml, 0.24 mmoles) and AIBN (20 mg, 0.12 mmoles). The mixture was heated at reflux for 4 hours. The reaction was allowed to cool and the solvent removed in vacuo and purified by column chromatography (Petrol: ether, 100:0, 75:1, 50:1, 20:1) and then  by prep tlc (3:1 petrol;CH2Cl~2). Yield 8mg, 43%
