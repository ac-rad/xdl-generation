The unpurified bis (4-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxyphenyl) diselenide (20.0 g 0.035 mol) was diluted with ethanol (200 cm3) and with magnetic stirring under nitrogen, solid NaBH4 (a total of 16.0 g. 0.42 mol) was added (exothermic reaction – up to 55 °C) in portions over 3 h, to give a colourless solution. Excess iodomethane (50 cm3 0.80 mol) was added and the mixture heated at 55 °C for 1 h. Water (250 cm3) was added and the mixture extracted with 1: 1 diethyl ether - 80/100 petroleum ether (3 x 100 cm3). The combined or­ganic phases were washed with water, HCl (1 M), dried (MgSO4), evaporated and the residue distilled to give a col­ourless oil, b.p. 76-80 ºC/0.01 mm, 8.0 g, 38% yield.
