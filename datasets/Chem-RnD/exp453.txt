LiCpâ€  (0.67 g, 5.28 mmol) was charged into a Schlenk vessel and THF (20 ml) added with stirring. Dimethyldichlorosilane (2.25 ml, 2.38 g, 18.50 mmol, 3.5 eq.) was added to the slurry. A pale yellow solution was formed. The solution was stirred for ca 12 h at ambient temperature, after which time it became a deep yellow and a precipitate (LiCl) was formed. The solution was filtered via cannula, the solvent removed in vacuo to give a yellow oil. This was washed with pentane (2x 30 ml) before being thoroughly dried in vacuo (1.02 g, 89%).
