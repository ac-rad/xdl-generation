1,8-naphthosultone (2.5 g 12.1 mmol) and KOH (10.1 g, 181 mmol, 15 eq) were charged into a schlenk vessel and heated to 300 Â°C for 1 h using an aluminium heating block (see note i). After cooling to RT, 100 ml of HCl/EtOAc 1:1 was added, and the solution was stirred for several hours, until all the solid material was freely moving/dissolved. A dark grey solid was removed by filtration and the solution diluted with H2O and EtOAc and separated. The aqueous layer was washed 3x with EtOAc. The organic extracts were combined and dried over Na2SO4. Solvent removed in vacuo, leaving crude product as a light grey solid (2.2 g). A short silica column (2-3 cm deep, 3.5 cm diameter) (EtOAc / Pet. Ether 9:1) was employed to further purify the crude product, to give 1.1 g of off-white solid (56 %)
