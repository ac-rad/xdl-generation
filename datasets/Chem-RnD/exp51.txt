To a cold solution (0 Â°C) of 6-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-6H-pyrano-3-one (65.3 g, 0.57 mol) in THF (600 mL) was added acetic anhydride (234 g, 2.29 mol) and sodium acetate (188 g, 2.29 mol).  The slurry was stirred for 18 hours at ambient temperature, following which, the resulting orange solution was filtered under pressure to remove any residual solid and concentrated in vacuo.  The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (1 L) and additional solid sodium hydrogen carbonate until effervescence ceased.  The organic portions were extracted into diethyl ether (2x1 L), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo (cold bath) to yield an orange oil.  Purification of this oil was achieved by column chromatography on silica gel with petrol: diethyl ether (1:4 v:v) as the eluent to give the required product as a yellow oil (59.6 g, 67 %)
