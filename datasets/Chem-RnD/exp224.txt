Synthesis of (1R,2S,3R)-1-(quinoxalin-2-yl)butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol: (30.54 g, 282 mmol) ortho-phenylenediamine was placed in a 500 ml round-bottom flask and suspended in 10% acetic acid (140 ml); D-glucose (10.16 g, 282 mmol) was added in five portions over 30 min. and the solution changed to a deep golden colour. The mixture was heated to 80ºC for 2 h and changed colour to a deep red, left to cool to ambient temperature and stored at +4ºC for 12 h. A mass of golden plate like crystals are deposited and the isolated by filtration, the solid was washed with a little cold water (2 x 20 ml) and dried in an vacuum oven (60ºC, 0.02 mm Hg) for 5 h. (25.0 g, 35 %).
