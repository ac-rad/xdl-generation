A 250 ml round bottomed flask with stirrer bar was charged with 2,2´-diamino-6,6´-dimethylbiphenyl (2.12 g, 10.0 mmol) and 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (4.44 g, 20.0 mmol) and hexane (100 ml). The mixture was stirred for 20 min, during which time the solution turned pale green/brown. Glacial acetic acid (0.5 ml) was added and the solution was stirred for 24 h, during which time it turned dark brown. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to yield a brown foamy solid. Analyses showed this to be the desired product (6.08 g, 98 % yield) with no 1H NMR detectable impurities. Recrystallisation from methanol gave a white crystalline solid. Volatiles were removed from the supernatant in vacuo and the residue recrystallised from ethanol. Yield from crystallisation 70-80%
