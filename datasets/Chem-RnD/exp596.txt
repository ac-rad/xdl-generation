General procedure: To a dried screw-capped vial were added benzamide 2 (0.10mmol), ethyl acrylate 3 (0.15mmol), 1b (4.8mg, 0.01mmol), AgSbF<sub>6</sub> (6.8mg, 0.02mmol), AgOAc (41.7mg, 0.25mmol), and 1,2-dichloroethane (1.0mL) under Ar atmosphere. The vial was capped and the mixture was heated at 60Â°C for 13h with stirring. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, saturated EDTAÂ·2Na aqwas added following dilution with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Organic layer was separated and aqueous layer was extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (Ã&#151;2). Combined organic layers were dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. After filtration and evaporation, obtained crude mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/EtOAc) to give product3.4.1.1 _4.1.4 <br/>(E)-Ethyl 3-(5-fluoro-2-(methylcarbamoyl)phenyl)acrylate (4d) <br/>A colorless solid; IR (KBr) ν 3082, 2984, 1721, 1635, 1558, 1321, 1182, 1034, 971, 855 cm<sup>-1</sup>; <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, 400 MHz) δ 1.30 (t, J=6.8 Hz, 3H), 2.99 (d, J=5.0 Hz, 3H), 4.24 (q, J=6.8 Hz, 2H), 5.95 (br s, 1H), 6.34 (d, J=16.5 Hz, 1H), 7.04 (ddd, J=2.8, 8.7, 8.7 Hz, 1H), 7.25 (dd, J=2.8, 10.1 Hz, 1H), 7.44 (dd, J=6.0, 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.91 (d, J=16.5 Hz, 1H); <sup>13</sup>C NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, 100 MHz) δ 14.4, 27.1, 60.9, 113.9 (d, J=22.9 Hz), 116.8 (d, J=22.9 Hz), 122.1, 130.6 (d, J=9.5 Hz), 133.4 (d, J=2.9 Hz), 135.5 (d, J=7.6 Hz), 140.8 (d, J=2.9 Hz), 163.5 (d, J=254.7 Hz), 166.3, 168.6; HRMS (ESI): m/z calculated for [M+Na]<sup>+</sup>: 274.0850, found: 274.0844.
