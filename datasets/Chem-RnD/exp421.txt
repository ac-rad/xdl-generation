(R)-phenylglycinol (1.0 g, 7.3 mmol) was dissolved in THF (10 ml) and cooled in an ice/water bath. A solution of di-tert-butyldicarbonate (1.08 g, 7.7 mmol) in THF (10 ml) and TEA (2.14 ml, 15.4 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at ambient temperature. The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to approximately half volume and hexanes were added to initialise crystallisation. The obtained solid was collected by suction filtration and washed with hexane. Yield 1.72 g (99%).
