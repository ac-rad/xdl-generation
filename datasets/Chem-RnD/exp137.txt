3,3-dimethyl butyne (0.3mL, 2.44 mmol) is stirred in THF at -780C and nBuLi (1.53mL, 2.44 mmol) is added dropwise.  The reaction is stirred at this temperature for 2 hours then SiEt3Cl (0.352 mL, 2.1 mmol) is added.  The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred until completion (TLC:5% EtOAc/PE, KMnO4, monitor for consumption of SiEt3Cl).  The reaction is quenched with ammonium chloride, extracted with ether, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated in vacuum on a rotary evaporator to give 412mg of colourless liquid (100%).
