A solution of  benzaldehyde (1.70 mmol, 0.172 mL), allylamine (1.70 mmol, 0.128 mL), cyclohexyl isocyanide (1.70 mmol, 0.211 mL) and 3-nitropropionic acid (1.70 mmol, 0.202 g) in 10 mL MeOH was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. After 28 h, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to leave a pale yellow solid. The residue was washed with cold Et2O (3 x 20 mL) to give pure title compound as a white solid (475 mg, 75% yield, mp 190-192 °C, Rf= 0.44 (ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1).  1H and 13C NMR spectra showed title compound is a mixture of two rotamers in an approximately 1:4.5 ratio.
