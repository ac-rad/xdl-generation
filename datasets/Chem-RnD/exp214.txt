Rh(acac)(CO)2 (2.0mg, 0.0078mmol) and adamantly caged phosphine (11.3mg, 0.038mmol) were placed in a microwave tube (or other sealable glass vial) and toluene (2ml) added. To this was added methyl crotonate (388mg, 3.88mmol). The vial was capped and two needles inserted through the septum. This tube was placed in an autoclave, that was then sealed and purged several times with syngas before pressurising to 50bar (Care: toxic/flammable gas). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 50Â°C with very fast stirring for 24 hours. The autoclave was vented and an NMR of the crude reaction mixture showed 95% alpha-aldehyde as a mixture of aldehyde and enol tautomers and 5% hydrogenation by-product. The crude mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1) to give 475mg (94%) of a pale yellow oil.
