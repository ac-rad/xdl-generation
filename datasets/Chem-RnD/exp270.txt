A Radley's reduced volume reaction vessel (10 mL), equipped with a stirring bar, was charged with the N,N-dimethyl-N'-phenylurea (1 mmol), benzoquinone (2 mmol), Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 (5 mol%), tosic acid monohydrate (0.5 mmol), THF (0.5 mL) and methanol (0.5 mL). The vessel was connected to a Schlenk line and with stirring at room temperature (18 °C) was briefly evacuated followed by charging with CO to 1 atm. This cycle was repeated 3 times and the vessel left open to an atmosphere of CO (1 atm). The reaction mixture was then stirred for 3h at 18°C. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in DCM and washed with HCl (1M). The organic layer was then washed with water, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography (10-40% EtOAc/ petroleum ether afforded the pure product as a colourless solid (88% yield).
