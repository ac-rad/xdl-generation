Nω-CBz-L-Ornithine (31.92 g, 120 mmol) was added to a mixture of KOH (6.72 g, 120 mmol), water (200 ml) and THF (100 ml) at 0 ºC. Trimethylacetyl chloride (12.3 ml, 100 mmol) was added dropwise keeping the internal temperature below 10 ºC. The reaction was stirred for 14 hours. The mixture was then extracted with 1:1 EtOAc / 40-60 petroleum ether (2 × 200 ml). Aqueous HCl (6 M) was then added until the solution was pH 2. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 200 ml), and the combined extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and then reduced in vacuo to give a thick colourless oil. This oil was dissolved in MeOH (650 ml), palladium hydroxide (20% on carbon, 400 mg) was added, and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature under hydrogen (1 atm.) for 14 hours. The mixture was then filtered through a pad of celite and the solvent was removed in vacuo to give the target compound as a white solid (14.9 g, 69%).
