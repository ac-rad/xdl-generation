N-Phenylanthrinilic acid (70 g; 0.33 moles) was stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature in phosphorus oxychloride in a large 3 necked flask fitted with an overhead stirrer and 2 reflux condensers. The mixture was warmed slowly using a heating mantle until the reaction temperature was self-maintained. The mixture was then refluxed gently for 2 hours, in which time the reaction mixture turned very dark. The reaction mixture was cooled, and the phosphorus oxychloride removed under reduced pressure. The residue was slowly added (CARE) to a mixture of ice (100 g); aqueous ammonia (200 mL) and DCM (200 mL). (Quantities may be increased if effervescence continues). The mixture was filtered through Celite, then the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3 x 200 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried (sodium sulfate) and concentrated. The solid product was recrystallised from acetone to give a yellow or brown solid.
