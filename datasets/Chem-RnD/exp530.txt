Temazepam (20 g; 0.067 mol) and  methanol (120 ml) was added to a 0.5 Lt, 4 necked flask bearing a mechanical stirrer, addition flask and thermometer, set up on a cooling tub at room temperature. Perchloric acid (70%; 2mL (10%/vol.) was added slowly through a dropping funnel keeping the reaction temperature between 20-25°C in 1-2 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature and was stirred overnight. Then distilled complete methanol under reduced pressure and residue adding to 50% Na2CO3 solution (200 ml). The reaction mass was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 X 200 ml) and dried over Na2SO4. The dichloromethane was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a light yellow oily liquid which on forced scratching with glass rod gives light yellow solid (18 g, 86%).
