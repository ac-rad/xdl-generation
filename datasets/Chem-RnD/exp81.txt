The cyclopentenone is stirred in DCM at 0C and the acetic anhydride, DMAP and triethylamine are added to this sequentially.  The reaction is stirred at 0C until completion (TLC), usually about 1 hour, then quenched with sodium bicarbonate solution, extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 15%EtOAc/PE.
