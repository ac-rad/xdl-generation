General procedure: To (S)-3-(3-amino-4-(benzyloxy)-lH-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-l-yl)-3- cyclopropylpropanenitrile (I- 109 A) (30 mg, 0.09 mmol), l-bromo-4-fluoro-benzene(24.5 mg, 0.135 mmol), Pd<sub>2</sub>(dba)<sub>3</sub> (20.6 mg, 0.022 mmol), 2-di-ieri-butylphosphino-3,4,5,6-tetramethyl- 2',4',6'-triisopropyl-l, -biphenyl (26 mg, 0.054 mmol), and potassium acetate (17.7 mg, 0.180 mmol) in a degassed sealed reaction vial, was added isopropanol (0.360 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 80Â°C overnight. The reaction was cooled to rt, and 0.2 mL of trifluoroacetic acid was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 3.5mL of DMSO, filtered using a 0.2 micron WHATMAN syringe, and purified with reverse phase chromatography, to afford compound II- 17.
