To a solution of potassium hydroxide (10.6 g; 0.19 mol) and potassium benzohydroxamate (11.21 g; 0.064 mol) in water (200 cm3) was added i-propyl bromide (8.86 g; 0.072 mol). The mixture was stirred for 5 days at 75 Â°C, then cooled in an ice bath, and acidified with glacial acetic acid.  The solid was filtered, and recrystallised (ether-hexane) to give O-i-propyl benzohydroxamate as white crystals (2.01 g; 19%)
