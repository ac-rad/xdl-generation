Preparation of 4-(9-anthracenyl)butyl bromide (2): To a stirred solution of 9-bromoanthracene (1) (3.084 g, 11.99 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (20 ml) under argon at 0 °C was added dropwise (4 min) n-butyllithium (7.5 ml, 2.4 M in hexanes, 1.5 equiv) and stirred at r.t. for 75 min. 1,4-Dibromobutane (5.8 ml, 4.0 mol equiv) was added at once to this mixture and refluxed for 2 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, partioned between dichloromethane (70 ml) and water (70 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 70 ml), the combined organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and the solvent remover under reduced pressure to give a yellow liquid residue. n-Hexane (80 ml) was added leading to the slow formation of  a pale yellow solid (2) (1.772 g, 47 %; Rf = 0.38 (n-hexane), m.p. 113-114.5 °C, m.p. 115-116 °C (EtOH, white needles). 
Preparation of 4-(9-anthracenyl)butyl azide (3): The 4-aryl-butylbromide (2) (1.546 g, 4.93 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of sodium azide (0.356 g, 1.1 equiv) in dimethyl sulfoxide (11 ml) at room temperature (water bath, 20 °C). After 19 h, water (22 ml) was added (CARE: exothermic) and the precipitate was filtered to give (3) (1.352, quant) as a yellow powder, Rf = 0.22 (n-hexane : dichloromethane 9.5:0.5); m.p. 78.5-79 °C (n-hexane, white small needles, complete decomposition when (3) is dissolved in refluxing ethyl acetate).
Preparation of 4-(9-anthracenyl)butyl amine (4): A mixture of 4-aryl-butylazide (3) (1.186 g, 4.31 mmol) and Pd/C (10%, 0.0436 g) in absolute ethanol (80 ml) under hydrogen atmosphere (balloon) was strong stirred for 2.5 days at room temperature. The mixture was filtered, the filtrate washed with dichloromethane (20 ml), concentrated in vacuo to give (4) (1.068 g, 99 %) as a brown viscous liquid. To the above residue, dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (20 ml, was bubbled excess  HCl. The solvent was evaporated and diethyl ether (30 ml) was added leading to the formation of solid which was filtered to give 4-(9-anthracenyl)butylamine hydrochloride (5) (0.927 g, 75 %) as a slightly yellow powder solid, m.p. 120 °C (dec), 204-208 °C.
