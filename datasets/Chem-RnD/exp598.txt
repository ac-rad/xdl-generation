To a stirred solution of tert-butyl 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-l,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)- 5,6-dihydropyridine-l(2H)-carboxylate (1.05 g, 3.40 mmol) in 5: 1 (v/v) 1,4- dioxane/water (30 mL) was added 3-bromobiphenyl (0.660 g, 2.80 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.16 g, 8.39 mmol) and [Ι, - bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) (0.102 g, 0.139 mmol). The mixture was heated at 80 Â°C overnight. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were washed with brine, dried (Na<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>) and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over neutral alumina using a hexane/ethyl acetate eluant to afford tert-butyl 4-([l,l'-biphenyl]- 3-yl)-5,6-dihydropyridine-l(2H)-carboxylate as a light yellow oil (0.900 g, 64percent). A stirred suspension of this compound (0.900 g, 2.50 mmol) and 10percent&gt; palladium on carbon (50percent) water; 0.180 g) in ethyl acetate (30 mL) was cycled between vacuum and a nitrogen several times. After the last evacuation, the reaction was refilled with hydrogen gas. The mixture was stirred overnight and then filtered through C elite. The filtrate was combined with ethyl acetate rinsings of the Celite and concentrated to afford tert-butyl 4-([1,Γ- biphenyl]-3-yl)piperidine-l-carboxylate as a yellow oil (0.898 g, 90percent&gt;). To a stirred solution of this product (0.898 g, 2.66 mmol) in methylene chloride (10 mL) was added trifluoroacetic acid (2.5 mL). The mixture was stirred overnight and then concentrated. The residue was taken up in aqueous sodium carbonate solution and extracted with methylene chloride. The combined extracts were dried (Na<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>) and concentrated to afford 4-([l,l'-biphenyl]-3-yl)piperidine as a light yellow oil (0.569 g, 90percent&gt;). This compound was reacted with Intermediate 5 using General Procedure A to generate the title compound. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCI3) δ 7.60-7.58 (d, J= 7.5 Hz, 2H), 7.47-7.35 (m, 6H), 7.21-7.20 (d, J= 7.5 Hz, 1H), 4.45 (s, 1H), 4.11-4.05 (m, 2H), 3.06-2.98 (m, 4H), 2.94-2.88 (m, 4H), 2.76-1.75 (m, 1H), 2.45 (m, 1H), 1.96-1.87 (m, 5H), 1.78-1.55 (m, 8H) ppm. <sup>13</sup>C NMR (125 MHz, CDC1<sub>3</sub>) δ 157.1, 146.0, 141.5, 141.2, 129.0, 128.7, 127.3, 127.2, 125.7, 125.7, 125.3, 58.8, 53.1, 47.7, 46.0, 45.0, 45.0, 42.7, 39.0, 36.3, 33.2, 25.9, 23.9, 23.6 ppm.
