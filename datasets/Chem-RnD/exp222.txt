In a one litre round bottom flask, a mixture of ethylacetoacetate (8.45 ml, 66 mmol ) and  cyanoacetamide (6.1g,72 mol) in distilled water (50 ml) was gently warmed on a water bath to attain solution and a solution of K2CO3 (30 g, 217 mmol) in 60 ml of distilled water was added drop wise over 30 minute by a dropping funnel. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It was then filtered and washed with water to give white solid which was dried over night at 100Â°C in a hot oven to obtained 9g of title compound in 91 % yield.
