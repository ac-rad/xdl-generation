A 3-neck 250 ml round bottom flask was equipped with a pressure equalising dropping funnel with a nitrogen inlet reaching into the liquid, a reflux condenser with a gas bubbler attached and magnetic stirring. The flask was charged with pyridine (0.80 g, 11 mmol) and methanol (100 cm3) and the solution stirred under nitrogen for 5 m. Dimethylglyoxime (2.32 g, 20 mmol) was added, followed by cobalt chloride (2.37 g, 10 mmol). The colour of the solution became red-brown but most of the dimethylglyoxime did not dissolve. Sodium hydroxide (1.6 g, 40 mmol) in water (5 cm3) was added dropwise over 20 s. When half of the NaOH was added, the formation of the cobalt(II) complex was complete, the solution became deep red-brown and sometimes some solid precipitated. After the end of the addition, the solution became blue-black (the cobalt(I) complex) after 5-8 minutes. 2-Bromoethylbenzene (0.92 g, 5 mmol) in methanol (3 cm3) was added dropwise over 20 s. After 2 m the colour had changed to yellow-brown and the solution was poured into water (300 cm3) and whisked with a glass rod to (a) encourage crystallisation and (b) incorporate oxygen to oxidise any cobalt impurities to give water soluble cobalt(III). The yellow precipitate was filtered and washed with portions, four or more, of water, stirring in air, until the filtrate was not deeply coloured. Drying in air gave a yellow solid (1.54 g, 65%).
