Intermediate 7:  2,2,2-Trifluoro-/V-(3-(sulfamoylmethyl)phenyl)acetamide       (0707)       [00428] Trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.45 mL, 3.24 mmol) was added  to a stirring suspension of (3- aminophenyl)methanesulfonamide (0.5 g, 2.56  mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL). The resulting tan- coloured suspension was stirred  at ambient temperature for 22 h. The mixture filtered and washed with CH2CI2 to  afford the desired product as a white solid in 98percent (0.7 g) yield.
