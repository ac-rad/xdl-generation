To a suspension of zinc dust (18.9 g, 0.29 mol, 6 equiv.) in 50 % aqueous acetic acid (125 mL) was added the carbohydrate (17.0 g, 48.16 mmol, 1 equiv.) in ethyl acetate (25 mL) over 1 hour at -20 Â°C with strong magnetic stirring.  As soon as all starting material had been added the reaction was complete by thin layer chromatography. The suspension was filtered while still cold and the residue washed with a little ethyl acetate (20 mL) and water (20 mL). The filtrate was diluted with dichloromethane (250 mL) and washed with cold water, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 50 mL) and brine (1 x 50 mL).  This followed drying of the organic fraction over sodium sulfate and solvent removal in vacuo to give the crude product.  After purification by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 5 : 1) the desired glycal was obtained as a white solid (5.8 g, 56 %).
