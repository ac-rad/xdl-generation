General procedure: To a solution of keto-aldehyde (0.200 mmol,1.0 eq) and PPh3 (63.0 mg, 0.240 mmol, 1.2 eq) in CH2Cl2(2.0 mL, 0.1 M) was added TMSOTf (43 μL, 0.238 mmol, 1.2 eq)dropwise at rt. After being stirred for 1 h at rt, the reaction mixture was then cooled to −40Â°C, and BH3Â·THF (0.28 mLof 1.08 M in THF, 0.302 mmol, 1.5 eq) was added slowly viasyringe. Stirring was continued at −40Â°C until the starting material was consumed (TLC analysis was conducted after quenching a small amount of the reaction mixture with a dropof TBAF (1.0 M in THF)). To the mixture were added saturatedaqueous NaHCO3 solution (2.0 mL) and MeOH (1.0 mL),and the resulting solution was then stirred for 2 h at 40Â°C.After being cooled to rt, the mixture was extracted several times with EtOAc (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure togive a residue. Purification was accomplished by flash column chromatography to afford the desired product.
