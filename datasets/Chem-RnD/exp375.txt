5-Hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-1-oxide (22.33 g, 178.45 mmol) was suspended in acetic anhydride (250 ml). The clear yellow mixture was then stirred at reflux (150°C) for 3 h, causing a colour change to dark brown-black. The solution was cooled to ambient temperature and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to leave a dark brown-black liquid, which was dried overnight in vacuo at 50°C. Yield = 36.59 g, 174.90 mmol, 98%.
