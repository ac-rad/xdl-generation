To 1,3,5-Tri-tert-butylbenzene (10.25 g, 0.042 mol) in carbon tetrachloride (20 ml) at 00C was added iron powder (2.5 g, 0.045 mol) and bromine (13.4 g, 4.3 ml, 0.084 mol).  The solution was stirred at 00C for 4 h.  The reaction mixture was poured into cold water (ca. 40 ml), and the organic layer separated.  Excess bromine was removed by shaking with a 10% NaOH (or KOH) solution.  The organic phase was then washed with water until neutral, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo.  The product was distilled with a Kugelrohr, and the fraction boiling at 152-1560C at 26 mmHg was collected.  Recrystalisation from petrol (or hexane) gave white crystals in 75% yield.
