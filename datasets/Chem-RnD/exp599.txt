A mixture of 4,4-dimethyl-7-(3-(tri luoromethyl)phenyl)-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l,8- naphthyridine (122; 61.2 mg, 0.2 mmol), phenyl pyridin-4-ylcarbamate (65 mg, 0.0.3 mmol) and 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (25 mg, 0.2 mmol) in acetonitriie was heated in a sealed tube at 60Â°C for 18h. The crude product was purified by loading onto a preparative TLC plate eluting with ethyl acetate/ petroleum ether (1 :3). This afforded 4,4-dimethyl-N-(pyridin-4-yl)-7- (3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-l(2H)-carboxamide (Compound 826) as a white solid. Yield 74percent. MS (ESI) calcd for C23H21F3N4O: 426.17; found: 427 [M+H].
