Tryptophan (2.004 g, 9.812 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (100 mL) and acetic acid (2.4 mL). The solution was cooled to 0 Â°C, and formaldehyde in methanol solution (23.5 mL, 1 M) was added. Sodium cyanoborohydride (1.234 g, 19.65 mmol) was added and then the reaction was warmed to room temperature. The solution was stirred for 6 days after which the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a white powder. Recrystallization from methanol and water afforded slightly orange-white crystals (1.664 g, 73%).
