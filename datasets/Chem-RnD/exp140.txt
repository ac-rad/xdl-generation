A zinc-silver couple was prepared:  Zinc filings (83 g) were added to a refluxing solution of silver acetate (0.1 g) in acetic acid (200 cm3).  The mixture was washed for a further 30 seconds, then cooled in an ice bath.  The mixture was decanted, and the zinc-silver couple washed repeatedly with ether until no acetic acid was present (judged by smell).  A zinc-silver dust was also prepared using this method.

To a mixture of acetonitrile (8.2 g; 10.4 cm3; 0.2 mol) and zinc-silver couple (filings; 18 g) in THF (5 cm3) and ether (45 cm3) was added, over a period of 2.5 hours, allyl bromide (32.4 g, 23.2 cm3; 0.27 mol).  The mixture was then stirred overnight, then poured onto a mixture of ether (100 cm3), saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (200 cm3), and ice water (100 g).  The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, then the aqueous layer was separated and extracted with ether (3 x 75 cm3).  The combined organic layers were dried, and the solvents removed under reduced pressure at room temperature.  Careful bulb-to-bulb distillation (105 Â°C @ 760 mmHg) yielded pure pent-4-en-2-one as a colourless oil (6.59 g; 39%).

Hept-1-en-4-one was prepared (0.108 mole scale) in a similar manner.  The solvent was ether (rather than ether/THF), zinc silver dust rather than filings was used, and purification was achieved using column chromatography (PE/DCM, as quickly as possible).
