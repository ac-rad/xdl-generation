N2O4 (9.5 cm3, 271 mmol) was added to a stirred and cooled (0°C) mixture of ethyl acrylate (44.5 cm3, 410 mmol) and iodine (31 g, 122 mmol) in diethyl ether (400 cm3). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0°C and then at room temperature for 4 h. The resulting dark solution was washed with saturated Na2S2O3 solution (5 x 200 cm3). The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (200 cm3) and the organic layers were combined and dried over magnesium sulphate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and excess ethyl acrylate was distilled off under vacuo at room temperature to give ethyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropanoate (31.1 g, 93 %) as a yellow oil
