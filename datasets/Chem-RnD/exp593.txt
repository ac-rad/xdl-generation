General procedure: To a solution of 2-phenylthiazole-4-carboxylic acid (S9) (1.0 eq) and HOBt (1.2 eq) in DMF (8 mL) were added EDCI (1.2eq) and a solution of HCl salt of S3a-cand S4a-d (1.0 eq) in DMF (4 mL) andEt<sub>3</sub>N (3.5 eq) at 0 Â°C. The mixture was stirred at room temperaturefor 24 h, then diluted in CHCl<sub>3</sub>. The organic phase was washed withwater (3), saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(3),and brine, and then dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Filtration,concentration in vacuo, andpurification of the residue by silica gel flash column chromatography (CHCl<sub>3 </sub>only → CHCl<sub>3 </sub>/MeOH = 50/1) gave S5a-c and S6a-d.
