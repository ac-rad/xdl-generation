Ceric ammonium nitrate (723 mg, 1.32 mmol) was added to a stirring solution of the N-(1-Isopropyl-vinyl)-N-(4-methoxy-benzyl)-malonamic acid methyl ester (100 mg, 0.33 mmol) in methanol or acetonitrile (4 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. The resulting solution was dropped onto H2O (25 ml), extracted with ethyl acetate (25 ml x 3), dried with MgSO4 and reduced to dryness in vacuo. Purification was carried out by flash chromatogtraphy (1:1 petroleum ether : ethyl acetate), to give the following cyclic products (Methoxy-lactam 74 mg,  67 %, Hydroxy-lactam 100 mg, 95 %).
