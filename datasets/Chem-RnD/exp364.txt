Anhydrous Aluminium Chloride (0.17 g, 1.3 mmol)  was added to a stirring solution of 3-(1-Pyrenyl)propanoyl chloride (0.19 g, 0.65 mmol) in DCM 15 ml) at 0°C under a dinitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was then left for 1 h under a dinitogen atmosphere at room temperature.The solvent was removed in vacuo, the residue was acidified with HCl (1 M) and then extracted with DCM (3 x 10 ml). The combined extracts were collected and dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent removed in vacuo to produce a yellow/orange crude residue. This was purified by coloumn chromatography using (8:2) chloroform : petroleum ether (40 - 60 °C) to yield dark yellow crystalline solid (25 mg, 15%).
