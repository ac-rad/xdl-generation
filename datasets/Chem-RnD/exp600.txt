[Production Example 16] <br/>3-t-butyldimethylsilyloxybenzoic acid methyl ester <br/>1.53 g of 3-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester and 1.69 g of imidazole were placed in a 50 ml flask, and a gas in the reaction system was replaced with nitrogen. <br/>5 ml of DMF was added into the flask and stirred at 0Â° C. <br/>The obtained solution was mixed with 1.57 g of t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, heated up to room temperature, simultaneously stirred overnight, and then mixed with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride to stop the reaction.. <br/>The reaction solution was extracted with diethyl ether, and the obtained organic layer was sequentially washed with water, a saturated aqueous solution of potassium hydrogen sulfate and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over magnesium sulfate.. <br/>The solvent was distilled away under reduced pressure to obtain 1.69 g of the title compound. Yield: 98percent. <br/>1H NMR: δ (CDCl3) 7.64(d, 1H), 7.49(s, 1H), 7.29(t, 1H), 7.29(t, 1H), 7.03(q, 1H), 3.91(s, 3H), 0.99(s, 9H), 0.21(s, 6H). <br/>
