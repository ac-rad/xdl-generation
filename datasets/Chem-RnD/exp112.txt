The trimethylsilyl ether (1.12 g, 3.09 mmol, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in freshly distilled methanol (15 mL/mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (213 mg, 1.55 mmol, 0.5 equiv.) was added.  The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature until starting material could no longer be detected by thin layer chromatography (1-5 hours).  After solvent removal in vacuo the residue was taken up in diethyl ether (15 mL/mmol) and the organics extracted with 1 N hydrochloric acid (3 mL/mmol), saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (1 mL/mmol) and brine (1 mL/mmol).  Drying of the organic layer over magnesium sulfate and solvent evaporation under reduced pressure gave the crude product. Purification by flash column chromatography (diethyl ether/petroleum ether, 2 : 1) yielded the alcohol as a white powder (0.80 g, 90 %).
