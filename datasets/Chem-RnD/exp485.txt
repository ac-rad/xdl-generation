The mixture of 4-methoxy thiophenol (100 mg, 1 mmol), formaldehyde (80 µl, 3 mmol) and isatin (105 mg, 1 mmol) in 0.1% TFA in water (5 ml) was stirred at 80 °C for 30 min. Completion of the reaction was monitored by TLC (20% EtOAc in n-hexane). Reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with EtOAc (50 mL × 2). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated on vacuo rotavapor to get crude product. Crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (mesh 100-200) using EtOAc: hexane as a mobile phase to get product in 95% yield.
