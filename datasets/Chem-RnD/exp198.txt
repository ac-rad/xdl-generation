To a stirred solution of m-chloropropiophenone (1 g, 5.9 mmol) and dichloromethane (5.0 mL) there was added, portionwise, 6.0 mL of a 1.0 M solution of bromine in dichloromethane. The solvent was removed under vacuum shortly after the addition was compleated and replaced by 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (5 mL) followed by t-butylamine (5 mL, 47.5 mmol). The flask was heated with stirring to 60Â°C for 10 minutes. The obtained red solution was treated with water (25 mL) and extracted with ether (3 x 25 mL), the combined ether fractions were washed with water (5 x 25 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The resulting yellow solution was transferred to a beaker chilled on ice and slowly with stirring treated with a 20:100 v/v mixture of conc. HCl in isopropanol until the contents of the beaker were acid to pH paper. (+/-)-2-(tert-butylamino)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)propan-1-one hydrochloride was collected with suction, washed with ether and allowed to dry, yielding 1 g (70%) of pure white crystals.
