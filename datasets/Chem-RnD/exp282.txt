All of the operations were performed in the dark. Iodine (2.5 g, 9.8 mmol) was dissolved in the solution of dry morpholine (2.7 g, 31 mmol) in dry DMF (40 ml) under argon. 2-Methylene-1,3-diselenole (1.0 g, 4.8 mmol) in dry DMF (25 ml) was added to the mixture cooled in water bath and was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The reaction was quenched with water (20 ml) and extracted with DCM (4 × 15 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with aqueous Na2S2O3 (2 × 50 ml) and water (3 × 20 ml), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvents were removed in vacuo (without heating). The residue was purified on column using DCM:hexane (1:2) mixture as eluent. The obtained product was additionally recrystallised from hexane. Yield 80 mg (4%).
