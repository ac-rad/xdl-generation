Step 1: 1,3-dithiolium hydrogen sulphate.  1,3-Dithiole-2-thione (10 g, 0.075 mol) was dissolved in acetone (200 ml) and cooled to -50°C in acetone/dry ice bath. Peracetic acid (50 ml of 40% solution, 0.3 mol) in acetone (120 ml) was added dropwise, keeping temperature below -40°C. Cooling bath was removed ,mixture was allowed to warm up to 10-15°C (after few minutes mixture starts to warm up rapidly!). Cooling bath was replaced immediately and the mixture was cooled again to -50°C. Bath was removed and the mixture was allowed to warm up slowly to 5-10°C. Filtered and sucked dry under constant stream of nitrogen. Yield 13.5 g (90%).  Step 2: 1,3-dithiolium hexafluorophosphate.  Sodium hexafluorophosphate (12.5 g, 0.074 mol) was dissolved in water (30 ml) and filtered. 1,3-Dithiolium hydrogen sulphate (13.5 g, 0.068 mol) was dissolved in water (60 ml), activated charcoal was added and the mixture was filtered into solution of hexafluorophosphate. Mixture stirred gently, flushed with nitrogen, capped and refrigerated overnight. Product was filtered, washed with cold water and sucked dry under a stream of nitrogen. Yield 12.2 g (73%)   Overall yield (steps 1,2) 66%
