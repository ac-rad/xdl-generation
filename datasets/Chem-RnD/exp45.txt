Pyridinium dichromate (1.04 g, 2.8 mmol, 2.5 equiv) was added to a solution of 1-trimethylsilylethynyl-cyclopent-2-enol  (200 mg, 1.1 mmol, 1 equiv) in DCM (5 mL) at ambient temperature.  After stirring overnight the reaction mixture was filtered through celite and washed with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and DCM (50 mL).  The solvents were removed in vacuo leaving a brown oil.  Purification was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with petrol: ethyl acetate (7:1 v:v) as the eluent.  (199 mg, 100 %).
