To a quick fit round bottomed flask charged 2-​methoxy-9H-thioxanthen-​9-​one (2.42 g, 10 mmol), concentrated hydrobromic acid (20 mL) and glacial acetic acid (20 mL) and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 6h with constant stirring.*  Upon cooling the reaction mixture was poured over ice (200 g) and distilled water (300 mL) was added slowly with vigorous stirring.  The yellow precipitate produced was isolated and dried at the vacuum pump to yield 2-​hydroxy-9H-thioxanthen-​9-​one (2.02g, 89%) as a yellow solid.
