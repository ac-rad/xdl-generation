1,4-dioctyloxy-2,5-diiodobenzene (12.90 g, 22 mmol), phenylboronic acid (6.29 g, 49 mmol, 2.2 eq.) potassium carbonate (7.297 g, 52.8 mmol, 2.4 eq), and PdCl2dppf (0.719 g, 0.88 mmol,  0.04 eq) were combined with a magnetic stirbar in a 500-mL 3-neck round-bottom flask with two of the necks stopped with septa and one fitted with a reflux condenser. Dimethylformamide (200 mL) was added, and the suspension was purged by bubbling with nitrogen gas from a long stainless steel needle. The purging was stopped and the reaction placed under normal nitrogen flow, and the reaction was heated at 80°C for 5 h using a mineral oil bath with a thermometer.
The reaction mixture was poured into a 1 L separatory funnel along with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and water (100mL) and swirled thoroughly. The aqueous layer was removed and the remaining organic layer washed twice with water, once with 0.1M hydrochloric acid, once with 0.1M sodium hydroxide, and once with brine. The resulting organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and rotary evaporated to dryness, yielding a black solid.
The resulting solid was dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane and poured onto a glass fritted funnel under water-aspirator suction that has been loaded with a 1-2 inch plug of flash-chromatographic grade silica gel. (See Author’s Comment) The crude product was eluted from the silica by pouring several portions of 20% dichloromethane in hexanes over the silica under vacuum, using an approximate total of 150-200 mL eluent. The solution in the filtering flask was rotary evaporated to dryness, giving a beige solid. The solid was dissolved in minimal dichloromethane and methanol slowly added until precipitate appeared, followed by cooling in an ice bath, filtration, and washing with cold methanol to give white crystalline product (4.80g, 10.23 mmol, 47% yield).
