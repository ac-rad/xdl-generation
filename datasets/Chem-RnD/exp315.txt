6-Bromoisatin (4.8 g, 21 mmol) was dissolved in NaOH solution (2.4 g in 60 cm3) by warming to 50 °C. H2O2 (100 vol, 5.5 cm3, about 48 mmol) was added dropwise (exothermic reaction) so that the temperature was maintained between 50 °C and 51 °C.    After cooling, the mixture was acidified with HCl (4M) to pH 3 to give a white paste which was filtered and washed with water (30 cm3).   The yield was 3.97 g (87%)
