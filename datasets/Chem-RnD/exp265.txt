MCPBA (0.62 g, 3.57 mmol) in 20 ml dichloromethane was added slowly over a period of 10 minutes to a stirred and cooled (0Â°C) mixture of 4-methoxystyrene 98 (0.40 g, 2.97 mmol) and NaHCO3 (1.0 g, 3.6 mmol) in 80 ml dichloromethane. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and then saturated NaHCO3 (50 ml) was added. The organic layer was removed. The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 10 ml) and the organic fractions were combined, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to flash chromatography eluting with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (PE; 5:1) to give a yellow jelly (0.34 g, 85 %).
