 2-phenylcyclopentanone oxime (0.5 g) was dissolved in diethyl ether (15 ml), the flask, containing the solution, was cooled in ice  and a slow stream of chlorine was passed into the solution through a delivery tube until the blue colour, which first formed, changed to green. The excess chlorine and the ether was removed in the fume cupboard in a stream of air and the residue dissolved in pentane, the solution washed with water , separated, and the solution dried over sodium sulphate, then passed through a column of alumina and the blue eluate concentrated and then cooled, with drikold and acetone, to afford a blue solid which was filtered off, placed in an agate mortar , and on warming melted to a blue oil (0.2 g., 34%). After a few days in a refrigerator, the oil solidified to a colourless solid which was then ground to a colourless amorphous solid. It dissolves slowly in benzene, more readily in chloroform.
