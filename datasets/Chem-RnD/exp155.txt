A solution of 3-methyl-2-butanone (1.1 ml, 10 mmol) and the p-methoxybenzylamine (1.3 ml, 10 mmol) in toluene (20 ml) was stirred under reflux in a Dean and Stark apparatus until no starting material could be detected by tlc analysis (typically 4 hours). The solution was then cooled to 0Â°C with stirring. Methyl malonyl chloride (1.1 ml, 10 mmol) was added dropwise to this solution, followed by the slow, dropwise addition of N,N-diethylaniline (1.6 ml, 10 mmol). The reaction was then stirred for 2 hours at room temperature and dropped onto H2O (30 ml). The organic layer was washed with 10% aq.HCl (10 ml), H2O (10 ml) dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo to give a residue which was purified by column chromatography, petroleum ether : ethyl acetate (1:1)(1.9 g, 63 %).
