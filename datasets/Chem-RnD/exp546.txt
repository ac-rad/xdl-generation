trans-[Rh(P(4-biphenyl)3)2(CO)Cl] (1): A J. Young’s Flask was charged with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (30 mg, 0.077 mmol) and P(4-biphenyl)3 (151 mg, 0.309 mmol), and CH2Cl2 (4 mL) added at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and the solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting yellow powder was washed with pentane (2 x 3 mL), to afford the pure product as yellow solid (Yield = 168 mg, 95%). Crystals suitable for X-Ray diffraction analysis were grown by slow diffusion of pentane into a CH2Cl2 solution.
trans-[Ir(P(4-biphenyl)3)2(CO)Cl] (2): A J. Young’s Flask was charged with [Ir(COD)2Cl]2 (150 mg, 0.223 mmol) and P(4-biphenyl)3 (438 mg, 0.892 mmol), and CH2Cl2 (4 mL) added. The reaction mixture was freeze-pump-thaw degassed, placed under an atmosphere of CO and stirred for 5 minutes. The solvent removed in vacuo and the resulting yellow powder was washed with pentane (2 x 3 mL). Crystals suitable for X-Ray diffraction analysis were grown by slow diffusion of pentane into a CH2Cl2 solution (Yield = 453 mg, 82%).
