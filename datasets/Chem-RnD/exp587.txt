General procedure: To a solution of 3-(6-chloro-2-(3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-7-yl)-5-cyclopropyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine-7-carboxylic acid (30 mg), morpholine (58 Î¼L), and HOBt (89 mg) in DMF (3 mL) was added WSC (128 mg), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. <br/>Water was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. <br/>The extract was washed with saturated brine, and dried over magnesium sulfate. <br/>The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane) and recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give the title compound (30 mg). <br/>MS (ESI+): [M+H]<sup>+</sup>564.4.
