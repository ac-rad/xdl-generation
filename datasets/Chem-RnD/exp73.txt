Thioamide (74 mg, 0.64 mmoles) added to AgClO4 (500 mg, 2.4 mmoles) in dichloromethanE (5ml) at -78 °C and stirred for five minutes. Methyl chloroformate (300 microlitres, 2.48 mmoles) was added to the mixture and allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was recooled to -78 °C and triethylamine (0.5 ml, 3.6 mmoles) was added and the reaction allowed to warm to room temperature. Water was added and the aqueous layer extracted with dichloromethane.  The combined, washed and dried organic layers were evaporated  to give the crude product. Purification by silica-gel chrompatography (petrol: ether as gradient 2:1, 1:1, 1:2) to give the title compound (67 mg, 60%) as an oil.
