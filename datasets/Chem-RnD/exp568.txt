Into a conical flask was charged 2-((4-methoxyphenyl)thio)benzoic acid (2.60 g, 10 mmol) followed by concentrated sulphuric acid (40 mL) in one full portion*. The mixture was heated to 100°C** with constant stirring for 30 minutes. The hot solution was carefully poured over ice (200 g); with vigorous stirring a yellow solid precipitated from the reaction which was isolated by vacuum filtration at the pump and washed further with water (100 mL).  The crude solid was recrystallized in the minimum amount of hot isopropyl alcohol to yield 2-​methoxy-9H-​thioxanthen-​9-​one (0.61 g, 25%) as bright yellow needles.
