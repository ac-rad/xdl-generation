Benzyl 2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate (2.23 mL, 12.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of (S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid methyl ester (1.11 mL, 10.0 mmol) in cyclohexane:dicholoromethane (2:1, 15 mL) at 0 °C. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (53 µL, 1 mmol, 0.1 equiv.) was then added dropwise and the reaction mixture was slowly allowed to warm to rt. After stirring for 20 h, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with dicholoromethane (2 × 15 mL). The filtrate was washed with sat. aq. sodium bicarbonate (20 mL) and sat. brine (20 mL), then dried (magnesium sulphate), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (Petrol:Ether, 99:1 to 98:2) to afford (S)-methyl 3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylpropanoate (2.05 g, 98%) as a clear oil.
