Bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)(5,6-dihydro-1,4-dithiine-2,3-diselenolato-κ2Se,Se')titanium(IV) (3.0 g, 6.66 mmol) and bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate (1.98 g, 6.66 mmol) were dissolved in dry THF (200 ml) under nitrogen. The mixture was heated to reflux for 1 h. Cooled mixture was quenched with methanol (10 ml) and stirred for further 15 min. The solids were removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated dry under reduced pressure. The residue was purified on silica using DCM:hexane (1:1) as eluent. Orange/yellow fraction collected. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was re-dissolved in acetonitrile (100 ml) and heated to reflux with activated carbon for 0.5 h. The hot solution was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to approximately half volume. The solution was left at -30°C overnight for crystallisation. Pale yellow solid was collected by filtration and washed with small amount of cold acetone. Yield 0.33 g (16%).
