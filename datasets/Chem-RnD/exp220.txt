Indole-3-carboxylic acid (0.56 g, 3.4 mmol) was dissolved in SOCl2 (6 mL) and stirred at 0°C for 1.5 h. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and to the resulting oil was added TREN (0.62 g, 4.2 mmol) and TEA (0.46 g, 4.6 mmol) in THF (25 mL).  After stirring at 0°C for 30 min, the solution was filtered under vacuum to yield 5 as a beige solid which was recrystallized in MeOH.
