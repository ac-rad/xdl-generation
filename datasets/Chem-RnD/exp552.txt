In a tared 250 mL beaker, o-vanillin (0.76 g, 5.0 mmol) and 2-bromoaniline (0.82 g, 5.0 mmol) were mixed (using a glass-stirring rod) until an orange oil was formed; after 25 min, 50 mL of hexanes was added to the reaction mixture, which was transfered into a 100 mL round-bottom flask. After 24 hours, small needles of crystals appeared in the flask. The hexanes was removed by rotary evaporation to provide the dark orange solid (E)-2-(((2-bromophenyl)imino)methyl)-6-methoxyphenol (1.39 g, 4.5 mmol, 91% yield).
