Freshly distilled pyrrolidine (1.421 g, 20 mmol) was added slowly into a solution of trichloroacetylpyrrole (2.125 g, 10 mmol) in DMF (15 mL). The mixture was stirred overnight before water (30 mL) was added. This was kept stirring for 10 min before dilute hydrochloride acid (2 M) was added dropwise until pH ca 8 as measured by pH paper. The ethyl acetate extracts (5 x 30 mL) were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a white solid. (1.38 g, 84 %).
