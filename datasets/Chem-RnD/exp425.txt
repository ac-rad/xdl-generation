A solution of methanesulfonyl chloride (0.93 ml, 12 mmol) in DCM (20 ml) was added dropwise over 30 min to a solution of (S)-tert-butyl 1-hydroxypropan-2-ylcarbamate (2.0 g, 11 mmol) and TEA (1.8 ml, 12.5 mmol) in DCM (40 ml). The volatiles were then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was redissolved in ethyl acetate (30 ml) and water (30 ml). The organic layer was washed with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (30 ml, 5%), brine (30 ml) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The product was obtained upon removal of the solvent under reduced pressure. Yield 2.1 g (75%).
