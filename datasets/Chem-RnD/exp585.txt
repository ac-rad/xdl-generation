General procedure: In a 10mL Schlenk reaction tube (Hinwil Beijing GlassInstrument Co., F891410 reaction tube, the capacity of 10mL, 14/20 groundjoint) was added bis (acetylacetonate) Ni (5molpercent, 6.5mg) and 1,2-bis (diphenylphosphino) benzene (7molpercent, 15.6mg), was fully replaced with argon threetimes the air tube, under an argon atmosphere and then add 1ml of toluene,diphenyl acetylene (0.50mmol, 89.2mg), formic acid (1.1mmol, 50.6 mg) andpivalic anhydride (20molpercent, 0.1mmol, 18.4mg); the reaction system was heated inan oil bath to 100 deg.] C and stirring was continued for 24 hours (using anIKA magnetic stirrer, the RCT basic, stirring speed of 500 rpm /minute). Aftercompletion of the reaction, the system was cooled to room temperature. Thereaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate, and then the reactionsolution was diluted with a rotary evaporator and concentrated way (Buchi,Switzerland Ltd., by BUCHI Rotavapor R-3). Concentrated residue was purified bycolumn (Hinwil Beijing Glass Instrument Co., C383040C ball with sand boardstorage column, 5/20, φ30mm, effective length: 500ml) chromatography to givethe product.The product as a white solid, 109 mg, 98percent yield,, purity&gt;99percent, eluent ethyl acetate: petroleum ether = 1: 50 to 1:10.Means of NMR obtained in Example 1 (E) -2,3- diphenyl-α, β-unsaturated carboxylic acid analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonancespectrum thereof obtained as shown in FIG. 1; its 13C to give shown in FIGURE2.
