2,3,3-Trimethylindolenine (0.48 g, 3.00 mmol), iodomethane (0.43 g, 3.00 mmol) and acetonitrile (3 mL) were added to a 35 mL CEM microwave reaction vessel and irradiated at 120°C for 10 minutes. The precipitate formed was isolated at the pump and washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and cold diethyl ether (10 mL) and dried in vacuo to give 1,2,3,3-tetramethyl-3H-indolium iodide  (0.76 g, 84%) as a pink solid.
