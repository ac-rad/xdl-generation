To a clean 2 l 4 necked flask carrying calcium chloride guard tube, thermometer pocket and a mechanical stirrer, was charged Dichloroethane (500 mL) followed by anhydrous aluminium chloride (177 g, 1.32 mol) under stirring. To this benzaldehyde (104 g, 1 mol) was added over a period of 1 h at 38-40 °C. After this bromine (176 g, 56.8 mL, 1.1 mol) was added over a period of 2 h at about 40 °C and further the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h. The reaction mass was quenched to approximately 1 kg crushed ice and stirred for 10 min. The organic layer separated was removed and washed with water ( 1000 mL) and 300 mL sodium carbonate solution(5%) followed by water (750 mL). The organic layer thus obtained was concentrated to get about 200 g residue. This residue was distilled under vacuum to get 160 g of pure 3-bromo benzaldehyde (Yield: 87%).
