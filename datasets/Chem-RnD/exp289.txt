1,2,4-triacetoxybenzene (50 g, 0.198 mol) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (100 cm3) and dimethyl sulfate (175 cm3, 1.849 mol). With mechanical stirring and ice cooling, a solution of NaOH (150 g, 3.75 mol) in water (150 cm3) was added so that the temperature remained between 25 and 30 ºC. After the addition was complete stirring was continued for a further 1 h then the mixture was allowed to stand overnight. Water (300 cm3) was added and the product was extracted with ether (4 x 100 cm3). The organic extract was dried (MgSO4), filtered,  and evaporated to give a brown oil which was distilled to give a colourless oil  bp 62-64 ºC/0.05 mm, 29.4 g (88% yield, lit: 90%).
