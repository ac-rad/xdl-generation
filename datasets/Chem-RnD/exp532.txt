Anisole (1.08g, 10 mmol), sodium bromide (3.6g, 35 mmol), oxone (10.72g, 17.5 mmol) were added together with approximately 20 copper-plated steel beads to a 50mL centrifuge tube on a vortex mixer and the mixture was vortexed for approximately 60 minutes. (See Notes) The contents of the tube were poured out onto a Buchner funnel and rinsed well with deionized water and the beads removed with a magnet. Air was pulled through the collected product for ca. 10 minutes to remove water and traces of bromine vapor, yielding 0.65 g dense white flakes of product. During this time, a second crop of crystalline product separates from the filtered reaction mixture and can be collected by a second vacuum filtration yielding 0.86 g solid for a total of 1.51 g (5.5 mmol, 55%) 2,4-dibromoanisole, >90% pure by GC/MS.
