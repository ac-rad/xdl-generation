The reagents are mixed together in no particular order in a conical flask at room temperature and stirred (usually overnight). The reaction then poured into aqueous HCl solution (sufficient to dissolve all solids) and extracted with ether and the organic layers then washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and water and dried. Purification by distillation (in this case bulb to bulb 200 Â°C @ 0.5 mmHg) or chromatography. Yield 3.13 g, 79%
