To 2-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydrofuran  (71.4 g, 0.717 mol) in THF (700 mL) and water (25 mL) cooled to 0 °C was added triflic acid (16.6 g, 0.107 mol) producing a dark colouration.  The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 3 h, after which acetic anhydride (292 g, 2.87 mol) and sodium acetate (235 g, 2.87 mol) were added.  The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature for 18 h, after which the solid was removed via filtration under reduced pressure.  The resulting brown liquid was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (500 mL) and the organic layer was extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 400 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting brown liquid was passed through a short plug of silica with petrol:ethyl acetate (5:1 v:v) as the eluent to yield the title compound as a yellow low melting point solid (77.4 g, 69 %).
