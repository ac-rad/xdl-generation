A solution of anti 1R*, 2, 2, 3R*-tetraallylcyclopentanediol 1 (50 mg, 0.19 mmol) was dissolved in dry, distilled DCE (2 ml). Grubbs’ catalyst [Ru(PCy3)2Cl2(CHPh)] (8 mg, 0.0095 mmol) in DCE (1 ml) was added via syringe. The reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C under N2 overnight. A further 5 mol% of Grubbs’ catalyst was added after 24 h. In total, 10 mol% of Grubbs catalyst had been added over 48 h with heating throughout. The solvent was removed in vacuo and purification on silica gel using 2:1 hexane:EtOAc supplied the desired tricycle 2 as a pale yellow oil. (28 mg, 72%)
