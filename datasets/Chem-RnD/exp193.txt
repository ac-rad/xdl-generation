The Grignard reaction was carried out under an N2 atmosphere. However, all work up procedures are carried out in air. Phenylmagnesium bromide, (2.8 ml of a 3M solution in toluene, 7 mmol) was transferred via a syringe into a suspension of cyclo-octadiene-diiodo-platinum (II), (0.98 g, 1.76 mmol) in dry toluene, ( 17 ml ). The bright yellow suspension went brown instantly. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then neutralised with 0.6 g of ammonium chloride in 10 ml of ice cold water. The organic layer was separated, with the aqueous layer being extracted a further two times with toluene. Organic extracts were combined, dried with sodium sulphate, and decolourised with charcoal. Solvent was then removed in vacuo. The easiest method to check the purity of [Pt(COD)Ph2] is to react a small portion (20 mg) of it with bis-diphenylphosphino-ethane (dppe) in a 1:1 molar ratio in 1 ml of CH2Cl2 (or 1:1 CH2Cl2 / CDCl3; 30 min. room temp), and record a 31P{1H} NMR spectrum on this solution. The compound [Pt(dppe)Ph2] should form quantitatively if the [Pt(COD)Ph2] is pure (41.3; 1JP-Pt = 1704 Hz). If the [Pt(COD)Ph2] is of high purity, filtration through a thin pad of alumina gives the desired complex as an air stable white powder. If impurities are detected, [Pt(COD)Ph2] can be purified by flash chromatography on silica (pre-treated with a solution of triethylamine in petrol ether) using 20% ether/ 80% petrol ether (40 / 60) as eluent (Rf [Pt(COD)Ph2]  0.5; Rf (impurity sometimes detected by us)~ 0.2) . Yield: 0.683 g, 1.49 mmol, 85 %.
