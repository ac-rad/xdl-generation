Into a 100 mL round bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere was added the diene (0.049 g, 0.15 mmol) in dry DCM (30 mL). Grubbsâ€™ 2nd generation catalyst (0.010 g, 0.01 mmol) was added as a solid to the solution. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser (still under nitrogen) and then put on an oil bath; the solution stirred 12 h at reflux. After, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography using 7:3 hexanes:ethyl acetate as eluent to yield 0.027 g (60%) of the spirocyclic product as a clear, colorless oil.
