A Schlenk flask was charged with iron powder (189 mg, 3.38 mmol) and nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate (790 mg, 6.76 mmol), the vessel was cooled to -78Â°C and dry acetonitrile (30 cm3) was added. The suspension was left to warm to ambient temperature and left to stir for 12 h. The resulting golden solution was filtered to remove any unreacted iron and insoluble materials and concentrated in vacuo to ca.10 cm3. The compound crystallised out upon layering with diethyl ether (20 cm3), isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo for 2 h. The solid was stored in the inert gas dry box thereafter. (1.38 g, 86%)
