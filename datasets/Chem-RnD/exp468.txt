To a clean 500 mL Lt 3 necked flask carrying thermometer pocket and a mechanical stirrer, was charged Longifolene (202 g, 1 mol) followed by Potassium hydrogensulfate (4 g, 2% by weight OR bromoacetic acid). The reaction mixture was heated on mantle to about 220°C (gentle reflux) and maintained at this temperature for 24 h (at this point of time, 13C NMR of the reaction mixture clearly shows the absence of 2 peaks for the olefin carbon at δ 167.36 and 99.34. You will see new peaks at δ 151.47 and 110.28 for Alloisolongifolene).The reaction mixture was cooled to about 50 °C and diluted with toluene (500 mL) and filtered. The combined organic layer thus obtained was washed with 10% sodiumcarbonate solution (250 mL) and concentrated to get about 195 g residue. This residue was distilled under vacuum (82-85 °C /1mm) to get 166 g of pale yellow Alloisolongifolene (Yield: 82%).
