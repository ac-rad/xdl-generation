5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4,4a,9,9a-tetrahydroanthracene-9,10-dione (1.7428 g, 7.25 mmol) was dissolved in 2 M sodium hydroxide (20 mL) and stirred vigorously open to air for approximately twenty minutes. The resulting thick, dark-brown mixture was cooled to 0 °C and acidified with hydrochloric acid dropwise. The mixture was filtered, washed with water, and dried. The crude product was recrystallized from ethanol to yield 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-dihydroanthracene-9,10-dione as golden-brown needles (0.9980 g, 57% yield).
