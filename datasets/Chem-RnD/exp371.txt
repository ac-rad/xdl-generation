1-(2-Pyridylacetyl)pyridinium iodide (10.06 g, 30.85 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and ammonium acetate (5.47 g, 70.96 mmol, 2.3 eq.) were dissolved in formamide (100 ml). Freshly distilled methacrolein (2.38 g, 2.8 ml, 33.94 mmol, 1.1 eq.) was added via syringe. The reaction was stirred at 80°C for 6 hours and then cooled to ambient temperature. Water (80 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was extracted into diethyl ether (3 × 200 ml). The diethyl ether extracts were combined, dried over sodium sulphate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to leave the crude product as a yellow liquid. Column chromatography was carried out on silica eluting with DCM/methanol (20:1). The pure fractions were combined and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The product was then dissolved in DCM, filtered through celite to remove any silica and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow liquid was dried overnight in vacuo at ambient temperature. Yield = 3.95 g, 23.21 mmol, 75%.
