To indole (10.07 g, 86.1 mmol) in ether (200 mL) was added dropwise oxalyl choride (14.6 g, 114.6 mmol) over 15 mins.  After stirring for 30 min, the solution was filtered to yield indole-3-glyoxalyl chloride as a yellow solid, which was rapidly dissolved in THF (50 mL).  To the indole-3-glyoxalyl chloride in THF at 0°C was added a solution of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (6.14 g, 42.0 mmol) and triethylamine (42.3 mmol) in THF (10 mL).  After stirring at 0°C for 1 h, the solution was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to yield tris(2-[indole-3-glyoxylamido]ethyl)amine as a beige solid, which was  recrystallized in MeOH to yield glassy crystals.
