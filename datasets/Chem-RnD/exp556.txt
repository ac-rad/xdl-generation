4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (0.38 mL, 4.0 mmol), then methyl acrylate (0.48 mL, 5.2 mmol), were both added to a 2 dram (7.5 mL) reaction vial. The mixture was stirred rapidly with a magnetic stir bar prior to adding 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (45 mg, 0.40 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 23 Â°C for 45 min; at which time, 4 mL of dichloromethane was added, prior to breaking up the solid with a metal spatula. The solid was collected via vacuum filtration using a hirsch filter. Recrystallization from a minimum amount of ethanol provided methyl 2-(hydroxy(pyridin-4-yl)methyl)acrylate (0.60 g, 3.1 mmol, 78% yield).
