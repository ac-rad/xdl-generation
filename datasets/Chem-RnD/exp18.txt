The cyclopentenone is stirred in DCM at -70C (acetone/liquid nitrogen slush bath) and the titanium tetrachloride is added dropwise, producing a dark colouration. Stirring is continued for 2-3 minutes and the reaction is analysed by TLC. If incomplete, the reaction is monitored every few minutes by TLC, and upon completion is immediately quenched with ammonium chloride solution. The organic layer is then extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 30% EtOAc/PE and should result in a yellow/orange crystalline solid.
