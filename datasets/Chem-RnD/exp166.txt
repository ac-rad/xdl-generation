A solution of 3,4-epoxytetrahydrofuran (80 mg, 930 mmol) in THF (5 mL) cooled to –78 °C is treated dropwise with TMSCH2Li (2.3 mL, 2.3 mmol, 2.5 eq.). After stirring at –78 °C for 1 h and then at 25 °C for 1 h, phosphate buffer (pH 7, 5 mL) was added. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 10 mL), the combined organic layers dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue by column chromatography (SiO2, 3 : 1 Et2O : 40 - 60 °C petrol) gave the product as a colourless oil (0.12 g, 73%).
