Toluene (30 ml) was added to a large schlenk vessel charged with 2,4,6-trimethyl aniline (1.0 g, 7.5 mmol), 2-bromo-6-methyl pyridine (1.0 g, 5.9 mmol) and dppp (102 mg, 0.25 mmol).  The schlenk was then vacuum degassed and left under argon.  [Pd2(dba)3] (101 mg, 0.11 mmol) and NaOtBu (0.85 g, 8.9 mmol) were added to a schlenk under an argon atmosphere and the toluene mixture added via cannula.  The resulting deep red/brown mixture was heated overnight at 100°C with stirring.  On cooling to room temperature diethyl ether (50 ml) was added.  The resultant dark red mixture was washed with brine (2 x 30 ml), dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting yellow oily product was precipitated by trituration with n-hexane and cooled to -30°C for 2 hours.  The yellow crystalline product was isolated by vacuum filtration (0.95g, 72 %)
