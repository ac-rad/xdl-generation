In a tared 250 mL beaker, o-vanillin (0.76 g, 5.0 mmol) and methyl 4-Aminobenzoate (0.76 g, 5.0 mmol) were vigorously mixed (using a glass-stirring rod) for 30 min to obtain a redish-orange homogenous dry powder; recrystallization from a mixture of 1:3 ethyl acetate:hexanes provided redish-orange crystals of methyl (E)-4-((2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)amino)benzoateÂ  (1.23 g, 0.43 mmol, 86%).
