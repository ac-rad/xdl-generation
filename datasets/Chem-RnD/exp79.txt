Ethyl-2,3 dibromopropenoate (21.2 g, 82 mmol, 1 equiv.) was added to a stirred solution of sodium iodide (24.6 g, 0.164 mol, 2 equiv.) in acetone (80 mL).  The resulting orange suspension was heated at reflux for 3 days.  The resulting brown liquid was filtered to remove inorganics and concentrated in vacuo.  The resulting brown oil was purified by chromatography on silica gel with petrol:DCM (4:1 v:v) as the eluent yielding the title compound as a red oil (23.5 g, 94 %)
