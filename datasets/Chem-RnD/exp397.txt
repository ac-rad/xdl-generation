Lorazepam (10 g, 31.15 mmol) added to toluene (50 mL) in a 250 mL Dean Stark apparatus under nitrogen atmosphere. Reaction mixture was refluxed and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After 24 h the reaction mixture was cooled to 5-8 °C and the white crystals thus obtained were filtered and dried under vacuum for 6 hr at 70-75 °C to give the quinazoline aldehyde as white crystalline product (9.23 g, 98%) which is pure compound confirmed by NMR studies and does not require any further purification.
