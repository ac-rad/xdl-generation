A Schlenk tube was charged with Cp*ZrCl3 (2.30 g, 6.9 mmol) and lithium dimethylamide (1.05 g, 20.7 mmol). Toluene (50 mL) was added, and the resulting yellow suspension stirred at room temperature overnight. After this time, the suspension was filtered through a Celite-packed frit and the solids washed with toluene until the washings were colourless. The toluene was removed in vacuo and the residue redissolved in pentane and transferred by cannula to a sublimation tube. The pentane was carefully removed in vacuo (very slowly, or otherwise it will bump, if this happens condense the pentane using cotton wool and liquid nitrogen). The resulting yellow solid was sublimed at 120Â°C and 10-3 mm Hg to yield the title compound as a slightly waxy yellow solid. Yield: 1.67 g, 67%
