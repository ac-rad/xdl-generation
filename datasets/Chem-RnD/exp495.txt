To a 50ml round bottom three neck flask, equipped with magnetic stirrer, water condenser, calcium chloride drying tube on top of the condenser, septum cap and nitrogen inlet was charged 0.196 g (0.72 mmol) of (4-trans-4-heptylcyclohexyl)aniline and 10 ml toluene. The mixture was stirred until homogeneous. Then 1 ml heptanoyl chloride was syringed into the solution and a copious white precipitate immediately separated with mild exotherm. The solution was then cooled to room temperature with an ice bath. The nearly quantitative precipitate was suction filtered, air dried on small watch glass. and taken up in 10 ml of boiling 190 proof ethanol. Cooling gave 95 mg (34%) of analytically pure N-[4-(trans-4-Heptylcyclohexyl)phenyl]heptanamide
