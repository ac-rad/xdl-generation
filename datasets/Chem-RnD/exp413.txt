A Schlenk vessel containing the cyclohexyl thiourea (2.0 g, 8.68 mmol) was dissolved in THF (20 mL) and purged with argon.  An emulsion of NaOH (0.87 g, 0.2 mol) in water (~3 mL) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (1.83 g, 9.60 mmol) in THF (~7 mL) was added slowly (~20 min).  The solution was then left to stir overnight.  The product was then extracted with dichloromethane and dried over magnesium sulphate.  The solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure to yield a white solid (yield 1.22 g, 72 %).
