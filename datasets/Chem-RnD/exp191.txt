To a solution of 5.1g (0.22 gram-atoms) of Na in 90mL of anhydrous MeOH, chilled to -10ºC in an ice bath, a solution of 20g (0.15 moles) of 4-Methoxy benzaldehyde and 23.9g (0.22 moles) of Methyl chloroacetate was added dropwise over a period of 3h, during which time the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred and finally the whole became a white paste. After the addition was completed, the mixture was stirred at -5ºC for 2h and then at room temperature for 3h. The mixture was poured into ice-water (350mL) containing AcOH (2mL); the precipitated white solid was filtered, washed with cold water and dried in a dessicator. The crude glycidate weighed 23g (75%). It was recrystallized from MeOH to give pure Methyl glycidate.
