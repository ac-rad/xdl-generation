To a solution of ester (0.65 g, 2.36 mmol, 1 equiv.) in ether (71 mL) cooled to –78 °C was added DIBAL-H (0.92 mL, 5.17 mmol, 2.2 equiv.) dropwise.  After 15 minutes the reaction flask was placed in an ice bath and stirring continued for a further 3 h.  The reaction was quenched by the addition of Rochelles salt solution (40 mL) until effervescence ceased.  Ether (50 mL) was added to the gum and stirring continued for a further hour.  The organics were extracted into ether (4 x 50 mL) and washed with water (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo yielding a yellow oil.  Purification of this oil was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with petrol :ethyl acetate (6:1 v:v) as the eluent yielding the title compound as a yellow oil (0.445 g, 81 %).
