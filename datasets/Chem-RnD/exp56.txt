Zinc chloride (120 g, 0.88 mol, 1.64 equiv.) was partially dissolved in acetone (1.25 L) and conc. sulfuric acid (4.0 mL) was added at room temperature to give a clear solution (slightly exothermic reaction, cooling in an ice-bath may be necessary on large scale).  The diol (D-galactose) (100 g, 0.56 mol) was added in one portion and the resulting white suspension stirred for 6 hours at room temperature.  A suspension of sodium carbonate (200 g, 1.89 mol, 3.4 equiv.) in water (300 mL) was added to the yellow reaction mixture at 0 ºC in medium sized portions.  The suspension was allowed to stir for 1/2 hour before filtration (discard solid) and solvent removal in vacuo (keep water bath temperature below 30 ºC, otherwise the sugar will decompose; Caution: the acetone-water mixture is likely to bump).  This gave the crude product as a yellow oil beneath the aqueous layer.  The organic fraction was separated from the aqueous layer, followed by further extraction with diethyl ether (3 x 250 ml).  The organics were dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed in vacuo to yield the desired product as a pale yellow oil (143.6 g, >99 %).  Purification is generally not necessary, but can be achieved by flash column chromatography (diethyl ether).
