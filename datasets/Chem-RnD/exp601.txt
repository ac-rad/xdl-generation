Preparation of (S)-4-tert-Butyl 1-((S)-2-(((4R,4aS,7aR,12bS)-4a-hydroxy-9-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,4a,5,7a-hexahydro-1H-4,12-methanobenzofuro[3,2-e]isoquinolin-7-yl)oxy)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl) 2-acetoxysuccinate <br/>A suspension of oxycodone (286 mg, 1.59 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) was cooled to -50Â° C. and treated dropwise with a 1.0 M solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (1.0 mL, 1.0 mmol). <br/>After addition was complete, the mixture was stirred at -50Â° C. for 45 min. <br/>The mixture was treated dropwise with a solution of (S)-4-tert-butyl 1-((S)-2-((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl) 2-acetoxysuccinate (0.47 g, 1.0 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (8 mL). <br/>After addition was complete, the mixture was stirred at -50Â° C. for 30 min. <br/>After this time, the reaction mixture was treated with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3*20 mL). <br/>The combined organics were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. <br/>The crude residue was purified by column chromatography (50 g C18 column, 10-100percent acetonitrile/water) and freeze dried to provide (S)-4-tert-butyl 1-((S)-2-(((4R,4aS,7aR,12bS)-4a-hydroxy-9-methoxy-3-methyl-2,3,4,4a,5,7a-hexahydro-1H-4,12-methanobenzofuro[3,2-e]isoquinolin-7-yl)oxy)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl) 2-acetoxysuccinate (89 mg, 15percent) as a white solid: ESI MS m/z 602 [C36H<sub>41</sub>NO<sub>11</sub>+H]<sup>+</sup>.
