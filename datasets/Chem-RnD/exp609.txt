A. <br/>N-Dansyl-ethylenediamine (1) STR1  <br/>To a solution of ethylenediamine (635 mg, 10.6 mmol) in chloroform (10 ml), a solution of dansyl chloride (285 mg, 1.06 mmol) in chloroform (12 ml) was dropwise added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, followed by addition of a bit of 1 N sodium hydroxide thereto for hydrolysis of unreacted dansyl chloride. <br/>The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the residue was combined with acetone. <br/>Insoluble materials were removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated. <br/>Water (50 ml) was added to the residue, and extracted with ethyl acetate three times. <br/>The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated. <br/>The residue was dissolved in a small amount of ethyl acetate, a bit of n-hexane was added thereto, and the resultant mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. <br/>The precipitate was collected and recrystallized from ethyl acetate to give Compound (1) (124 mg). <br/>Yield, 63 percent. <br/>
