N,N’-Bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenylamine)ethane dihydrochloride (37.33g, 0.082 mol) was placed in a round bottom flask with a stirbar. Triethyl orthoformate (463 mL) and formic acid (4 drops) were added. The flask was fitted with a condenser and the mixture was heated at reflux for 48h open to the air. After cooling to ambient temperature a white crystalline solid formed. The solid was collected by filtration and placed in a round bottomed flask. The excess triethyl orthoformate was removed by heating the solid at 70°C under vacuum (1x10-2mbar) for 8h to yield 28g of the product (80% yield).
