2,6-Bis(dibromomethyl)anisole (13.42 g, 30 mmol) was suspended in 90% HCHO(aq) (70 ml) and heated at reflux for 16 hours.  The deep-red coloured solution was allowed to cool and was then poured into cold water (200 ml).  The precipitate was collected via filtration and then recrystallised from water to give 2,6-diformylphenol as white crystals (2.70g, 60%).
