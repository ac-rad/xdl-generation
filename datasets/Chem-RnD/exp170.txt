(2S)-g-N-Diethoxyphosphoryl-aN,aN-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-asparagine tert-butyl ester 

a-tert-Butyl N,N-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-aspartate potassium salt  (515 mg, 1.20 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (11 mL) with some molecular sieves (4A, 1.6 mm pellets). Ethylchloroformate (855 uL, 970 mg, 8.7 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred for 75 min. Some colourless solid was observed to precipitate at this point (KCl).
 In a second flask, diethylphosphoramidate ((EtO)2P(O)NH2, 1.1 g, 97%, 6.9 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (5mL), cooled to -78 Â°C and butyl lithium (2.76 mL, 2.5 M, 6.9 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min, allowing it to reach RT. The deprotonated phosphoramidate solution was added dropwise to the first reaction mixture and then stirred overnight at RT.
	Diluted HCl was added to the crude reaction mixture until pH 3 was achieved. The product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 x 50 mL), the organic layers were collected together, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and the solvent was evaporated. A pale red oil was obtained (1.27g). The crude mixture was purified by column chromatography (30% EtOAc:70% Petrol (Rf 0.05) as eluent, increasing the ratio of EtOAc up to 100%, Rf 0.61) to give (2S)-g-diethoxyphosphoryl-aN,aN-bis(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-asparagine tert-butyl ester as a colourless oil (310 mg, 588 mmol, 49%);
