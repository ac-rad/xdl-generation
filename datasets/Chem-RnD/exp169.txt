To a mixture of cinnamyl alcohol (0.134 g, 1 mmol) and sodium cyanide (0.049 g, 1 mmol) stirring in THF (10 mL) at ambient temperature and pressure, was added manganese(IV) oxide (1.34 g, 15 mmol). The reaction was heated at reflux for 5 hours. The resulting mixture was then filtered through a pad of CeliteÂ® and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Extraction with dichloromethane (50 mL) was followed by washing with water (2 x 10 mL) and then saturated sodium chloride solution (10 mL), before drying the organic layer over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of solvent in vacuo gave methyl trans-cinnamate (0.113 g, 70%) as light yellow crystals.
