Add methylhex-5-ynoate (1eq, 6.96mmol) to benzene or toluene (ca. 100mL) and stir.  Add AIBN (0.25eq), tosyl bromide (1.2eq) and warm to external oil bath temperature of 65-70 Â°C under nitrogen atmosphere.  Monitor by tlc after a few hours or after overnight.  If little reaction has occurred add more AIBN (0.25eq) and continue monitoring in this way. Typical conditions require around 0.25-0.5eq AIBN reaction time 16h to 80h.  When adjudged complete, remove solvent, column by flash column chromatography.  Yield: 63 %, colourless oil.
