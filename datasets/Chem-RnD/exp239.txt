A solution of diisopropylethylamine (5.8 g, 45mmol) in diethyl ether (10 cm3) was added dropwise to a vigorously stirred and cooled (0Â°C) solution of ethyl 2-iodo-3-nitropropanoate Page 286 (10.0 g, 37 mmol) in diethyl ether (200 cm3) and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The resulting suspension was filtered through a plug of silica. The silica was flushed with 10% diethyl ether in petroleum ether and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give an orange solid. The orange solid was passed through a short column of silica gel using petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1) as the eluent to afford title compound (4.00 g, 73 %) as a yellow solid.
