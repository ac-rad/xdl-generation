A solution of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (0.805 mmol, 200 mg) in MeOH (7 mL) was treated with benzaldehyde (1.61 mmol, 0.164 mL), a solution of cyclohexyl isocyanide (1.61 mmol, 0.197 mL) in MeOH (3 mL), and chloroacetic acid (1.61mmol, 152 mg) in the order given. The reaction mixture was stirred for 26 hours at room temperature, and then filtered. The precipitate was washed with first Et2O and then with n-hexane to remove unreacted reagents or by-products and dried to give white Ugi adduct (600 mg, 90%). m.p. 222-225Â°C, Rf(80%EtOAc/n-hexane): 0.82
