To a solution of the alcohol (3.26 g, 19.18 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dry dichloromethane (65 mL) was added chlorotriethylsilane (3.9 mL, 3.47 g, 23.01 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) at -8 ÂºC and the solution allowed to stir for 15 minutes before slow addition of distilled triethylamine (3.5 mL, 2.52 g, 24.95 mmol, 1.3 equiv.) took place over 30 minutes.  The resulting solution was allowed to slowly warm to room temperature while stirring for 7 hours.  The suspension was quenched with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (15 mL) and the organics washed with water (15 mL) and brine (15 mL), followed by drying over magnesium sulfate and solvent reduction in vacuo.  Purification by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 10 : 1) gave the desired product as a pale yellow oil (5.39 g, 99 %).
