To a solution of sarcosine anhydride (3.75 g, 26.4 mmol) in o-dichloromethane (15 mL), at 150Â°C, was added dropwise Br2 (3.0 mL, 58.1 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene (6 mL), under illumination of a sun lamp. The solution was heated for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. A stream of N2 was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 10 min, and the solution was diluted with hexanes. The resulting beige crystals of 3,6-dibromo-1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione were filtered and rinsed with hexanes (7.06 g; 89.1%). To a solution of indole (0.30 g, 2.6 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL) was added 3,6-dibromo-1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione (0.30 g, 1.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, diluted with methanol and filtered to yield the bisindolyl product as a white, crystalline solid (0.34 g; 91.4%).
