To a solution of 3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one (2a, 1.0 mmol) and sodium hydride (2.0 mmol) in 10mL DMF was added methyl iodide (1.1 mmol), the mixture was stirred at 25 Â°C for 3 h as monitored by TLC. The reaction was quenched with water and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã&#151;40 mL). And then, the combined organic phase was washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol=100/1) to afford 1-methyl-3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one as a white solid (226.5 mg, 96percent yield), mp 125 Â°C (lit. 124Â°C)<sup>1n</sup>; <sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) δ 8.57 (dd, J=8.3, 1.6Hz, 1H), 7.75–7.62 (m, 4H), 7.41 (m, 4H), 7.34–7.28 (m, 1H), 3.85 (s, 3H); <sup>13</sup>C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) δ 175.84, 142.57, 140.00, 135.48, 132.01, 128.67(2C), 128.28(2C), 127.63, 127.28, 127.04, 123.77, 122.02, 115.09, 40.74; HRMS (ESI) calculated for C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>14</sub>NO [M+H]<sup>+</sup> 236.1070, found 236.1072.
