To a stirring solution of 2-chloroethane-1-sulfonyl chloride (10 g, 61.34 mmol) in DCM (100 mL) at -15°C, was added dropwise a premixed suspension of 4-methyl-benzyl amine  (8.2 g, 67.48 mmol) and NEt3 (12.4 g, 122.68 mmol) in DCM (25 mL).  The reaction mixture was left to stir for a further 30 minutes after addition, and then left to warm to RT.  The reaction was diluted with more DCM (50-60 mL) and washed with 2M HCl (3 x 80 mL), H2O (1 x 80 mL), dried (MgSO4), and filtered.  The filtrate collected was concentrated in vacuo to give the crude which was purified by flash chromatography (starting 3:1 Petroleum ether 40-60°C/Et2O) to furnish the desired product (11.7 g, 90%) as white crystals.
