A mixture of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol (41.40 g, 0.30 mol) and hydrochloric acid (37%; 75 mL, 0.90 mL) was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The product was extracted with petroleum ether (40 mL), the extract washed with water (3 Ã— 50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give p-methoxybenzyl chloride as a colorless oil (45.35 g, 97% yield).
