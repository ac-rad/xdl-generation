1,4-dimethoxybenzene (0.56 g, 4.0 mmol) was placed in a mortar and pestle and sodium bromide (0.82 g, 8.0 mmol) was added. Oxone (2.45 g, 4.0 mmol) was added and the mixture was ground for approximately 15 min in the mortar until the reaction mixture had attained a uniform waxy texture. The solid was washed with water while grinding in the mortar, and collected on a fritted funnel. The product was recrystallized from 95% ethyl alcohol by transferring the solid to an Erlenmeyer flask and gradually heating with a heat gun while adding ethanol until the solid dissolved entirely. Slow cooling on the bench to room temperature followed by cooling in an ice bath gave white, needle-like crystals, which were collected by Buchner filtration and rinsed with ice-cold ethanol.
