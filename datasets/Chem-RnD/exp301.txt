Trifluoroacetic anhydride (6 cm3, 43 mmol) was added to phthalic acid monomethyl ester (1.8 g, 10 mmol) which dissolved in 1 m. After 5 m a solution of 2,3,6-trimethoxyltoluene (1.8 g, 10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (6 cm3) was added dropwise over 5 m at 25 ÂºC. After 6 h the solvents were evaporated to give a dark green oil. Recrystallisation from cyclohexane (70 cm3) gave white crystals (1.97 g) and a further amount (0.28 g, a total yield of 81%) after reducing the volume to 25 cm3.
