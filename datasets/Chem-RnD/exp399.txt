To a vigorously stirred mixture of Pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (2.000 g, 0.021 mol) and Aminoacetonitrile hydrogensulfate (6.483 g, 0.042 mol) in a 100 mL beaker, was slowly added 4 N NaOH solution. The slow addition of 4 N NaOH solution was continued till the reaction mixture attained a pH of 5-6. On further stirring, the product precipitated out as a faint yellow solid and was collected by filtration under vacuum. Washing the solid with water and drying under vacuum afforded 2.150 g (77 %) of a spectroscopically pure product which turned dark even on storage under nitrogen gas.
