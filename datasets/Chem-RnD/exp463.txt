The solution of syn-3-benzyl-1,5,7-trimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-9-ol (200 mg, 0,73 mmol) in 20 mL of acetonitrile was mixed with the solution of bis-benzonitrile palladium dichloride (280 mg, 0.73 mmol) in 5 mL of the same solvent. Triethylamine (0.06 mL, 0.73 mmol) was added to the stirred solution. After 24 h at ambient temperature a dark grey precipitate of the prooduct had formed which was isolated by filtration and dried in air. Yield 220 mg (67%).
