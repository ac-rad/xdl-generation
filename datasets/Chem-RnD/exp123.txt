To THF (100 cm3) at 0 °C was added i-propanol (0.56 g; 9.25 mmol), N-hydroxyphthalimide (3.00 g; 18.5 mmol), triphenylphosphine (4.82 g; 18.5 mmol), and diethyl azodicarboxylate (3.2 cm3; 20.2 mmol) in that order.  The mixture was warmed to 50 °C, and stirred at this temp for 3 days.  The mixture was cooled and concentrated.  Ether was added, and the solution was washed 5 times with saturated sodium carbonate solution.  The aqueous layers were back extracted with ether, and the organic layers dried (MgSO4) and concentrated.  The product was purified by column chromatography (PE/ether) to give colourless crystals (1.61 g; 85%)
