6-(Hydroxymethyl)pyridin-3-ol (6.74 g, 53.86 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in isopropanol (200 ml) to give a brown solution. Activated manganese(IV) oxide (11.71 g, 86.94 mmol, 2.5 eq.) was then added as a solid. The black mixture was stirred at reflux (100°C) for 4 h and then stirred at ambient temperature for a further 18 h. The solution was filtered through celite and the remaining MnO2 was washed with isopropanol (5 × 150 ml). The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure to leave a yellow-brown solid. The solid was recrystallised from hot water (~ 20 ml) to leave the pure product as brown crystals. Yield = 3.99 g, 32.41 mmol, 60%.
