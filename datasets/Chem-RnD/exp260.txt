Dimethyl sulfoxide (510 µL, 7.21 mmol, 4 equiv.) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of oxalyl chloride (310 µL, 3.60 mmol, 2 equiv) in dichloromethane (6.7 mL) at -78 °C. After stirring for 30 min, a solution of (R)-3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylpropan-1-ol (325 mg, 1.80 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dichloromethane (1.8 mL) was added via cannula. Stirring was continued for a further 1 h at -78 °C, then triethylamine (1.26 mL, 9.01 mmol, 5 equiv.) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt (ca. 1 h). 1.0 M aq. ammonium chloride (14 mL) was then added and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed with 1.0 M aq. ammonium chloride (5 × 10 mL) and sat. brine (15 mL), then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford (S)-3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylpropanal (314 mg, 98%) as a yellow oil.
