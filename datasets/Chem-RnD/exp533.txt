The haloalkane (1.1eq) was added dropwise to a stirred 1:1 mixture of 1-methylimidazole (1eq) and anhydrous ethyl acetate at 0°C. After complete addition the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 30 minutes before slowly warming to 60°C. Progress was monitored by 1HNMR. At 10-14 days the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and the upper phase of the biphasic mixture was removed under schlenk conditions. Further anhydrous ethyl acetate was added and the mixture stirred vigorously between a few hours to overnight. The upper phase was then removed and the lower (ionic liquid) phase analysed by 1HNMR. The washing step was repeated until the lower  phase was free of starting materials. If necessary, as judged by the colour of the lower phase, activated decolourising charcoal was added and the mixture (in water or methanol) stirred at 50°C overnight then cooled and filtered through a bed of Celite®.  Additional filtration through a 0.2 micron PTFE filter removes any residual particulates. The filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure and dried under high vacuum at 55°C to afford clear viscous oils.
