3,4-dihydro-5H-Benzo[cd]pyren-5-ol (0.1 g, 0.39 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform (30 ml) and Aberlyst 15 (0.1 g) added under a dinitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was heated to 30°C and left overnight under the inert atmosphere. The solution was then filtered to seperate the Amberlyst and washed with chloroform. The combined solvents were removed under vacuum using a Rotary evaporator. The crude product was column chromatographed under a dinitrogen atmosphere eluting with 1:1 chloroform:petroleum ether 40-60°C. A white solid was obtained using this method (50 mg, 54%).
