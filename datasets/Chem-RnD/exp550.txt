A 500 mL, three-necked round bottom flask was purged with N2 and cooled to -78°C. Dry THF (50 mL) was cannulated into the flask, followed by addition of freshly distilled d-valerolactone (5 mL, 0.054mol). Slowly, and with stirring, LDA (13 mL, 0.059mol) was added. DMPU (39 mL, 0.323mol) was cannulated into the flask. After 1 hour, 4-nitrobenzylbromide (11.6 g, 0.054 mol) was added and the reaction was left for 4 hours at -78°C, then warmed to room temperature. The solution was quenched slowly with methanol and the product was extracted with EtOAc and washed with saturated NH4Cl solution. Rotary evaporation yielded a clumpy red precipitate. The crude product was dry-loaded onto silica gel and purified using column chromatography (1:3 DCM/hexanes to 100% DCM). The collected product was rotovapped down to a yellow solid, which was recrystallized from diethyl ether to yield an orange-yellow, pure product (9.7%).
