In a tared 250 mL beaker, o-vanillin (0.76 g, 5.0 mmol) and 3,4-dimethylaniline (0.61 g, 5.0 mmol) were were vigorously mixed (using a glass-stirring rod) for 30 min to obtain a bright orange homogenous dry powder; recrystallization from hexanes provided orange crystals of (E)-2-methoxy-6-((p-tolylimino)methyl)phenol (1.19 g, 4.8 mmol, 93% yield).
