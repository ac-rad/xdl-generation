To a solution of chloromethyl ethyl ether (1.82; 18.3 mmol) in THF (3 cm3) (in a 100 cm3 round-bottomed flask)was added glyoxal-bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imine (6.89 g; 18.3 mmol) in THF (40 cm3), and 2 drops of water. The flask was degassed by passing nitrogen into it for a short period of time, and sealed with a rubber septum. The mixture was stirred at 40°C for 16 hours, then cooled and filtered, and dried under vacuum. The product was obtained as a pink-white solid (1.71 g; 35%), m.p. 280 °C (dec.), lit. (Arduengo) >255 °C.
