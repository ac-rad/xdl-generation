To a round bottomed flask was added thioxanthen-9-ol (0.5 g, 2.3 mmol), 2-nitroaniline (0.4g, 2.9 mmol), acetic acid (0.25 mL) and ethanol (10 mL)*. The reaction mixture was fitted with a condenser and heated to reflux with constant stirring.**  After two hours at reflux, the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, a glass stopper fitter and orange mixture transferred to a freezer and left overnight***.  The precipitate produced was isolated under vacuum filtration and washed with cold ethanol to give N-(2-nitrophenyl)-9H-thioxanthen-9-amine (0.16g, 20%) as an orange precipitate.
