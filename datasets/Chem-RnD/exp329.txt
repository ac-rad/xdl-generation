A solution of  POCl3 (1.01 mmol, 0.094 mL) in CHCl3 (3.5 mL) was added dropwise to a mixture of N-(2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)-3-nitro-N-(prop-2-ynyl)propanamide (0.674 mmol, 250 mg) and Et3N (2.70 mmol, 0.376 mL) in CHCl3 (3.5 mL). After 30 min Et3N (1.35 mmol, 0.188 mL) POCl3 (0.505 mmol, 0.047 mL) in CHCl3 (1.5 mL) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere at which point water (20 mL) was added. The crude product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3x15 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After evaporation of the organic solvent, the crude product was purified by flash chromatography using silica gel (eluent: ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1) to obtain title compound as a cream color solid (171 mg, 72% yield,  mp 201-204 °C, Rf= 0.32   (ethyl acetate-hexane; 1 : 1).
