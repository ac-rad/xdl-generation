Acetylferrocene (2.3 g, 10 mmol) was suspended in methanol (100ml) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The solution was sonicated at maximum power 1-2 minutes using a laboratory ultrasound bath until the solid was completely dissolved. Sodium borohydride (0.8g, 21 mmol) was added in one portion, the flask was fitted with an air-cooled reflux condenser, and a magnetic stirbar was added.  The solution was clamped in a mineral oil bath on a stirring hotplate and heated to 60 °C with stirring overnight. The mixture was poured into crushed ice (100ml) resulting in a fine yellow precipitate of the alcohol which was collected by vacuum filtration on a Buchner funnel and dried under house vacuum (ca. 100 Torr) for several hours to yield the product as fine yellow powder. (2.0 g, 87% yield) The product was dissolved in toluene (40 ml).  Dehydrated copper sulfate (1 g, see Author's Comments for preparation) was added. The mixture was heated to reflux for 1 h and filtered through a fluted paper. The toluene was removed by evaporation using a stream of air. (see Author's Comments) The product was dissolved in a minimal amount of hexanes and a fritted glass funnel was filled with 2-3 cm of silica gel and fitted on a filtering flask. (see Author's Comments) The solution of product in hexanes was pulled through the silica plug by vacuum from a water aspirator, and the silica eluted with several small portions of hexane until the color of product was absent from the eluting solvent. The  solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to give a dark orange-red crystalline solid (0.65 g, 34%, 30% overall).
