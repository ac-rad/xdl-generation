1.  Coupling of phenol to resin:  Add phenol (4.254g, 18.65mmol, 3 eq) to 10mL DMF and dissolve by sonication.  Cool in ice water bath and add 4 eq DIPEA (4.33 mL). In separate vessel add 2eq of DIPEA (2.17mL) to EDC (3.575g, 18.65mmol, 3eq) in about 5 mL DMF to give slurry.  Add slurry in portions to the phenol solution, it will dissolve as it reacts.  Sonicate for about 10 min more for complete dissolution and to allow for active ester/anhydride formation. Meanwhile pre-swell the resin (8.0g, 1 eq, 0.777mmol/g, 6.216 mmol) in minimum volume of DCM and then add the coupling solution and shake overnight adding more DCM if required to give good mixing, but keeping overall concentration as high as possible. Wash resin with DMF, DCM, diethyl ether and THF 3 x 40mL each with mixing.  Ninhydrin spot test seems to be the most sensitive way of checking for the complete consumption of amine.   Just add a few drops of commercially available 2% ninhydrin solution (HIGHLY TOXIC!) in n-butanol to a few beads of resin in a glass vial and heat carefully in a fume hood using a heat gun.  Positive test is purple after a couple of mins.  Perform an analogous test on a control resin which should give a negative result (eg chloromethyl).     If free amine is still detected, repeat the coupling procedure as above, using 2/3 the amount of each reagent.   2.  Cleavage of tetrafluorophenol-tetrafluorobenzoic acid esters: These esters will form due to the phenol coupling to itself.  Destroying them is easily performed by suspending the resin in 20% piperidine/DMF for 1h with mixing.  Wash resin thoroughly as piperidine sticks to resin.  Use DMF, THF, Et2O and DCM as before.                     3. Quenching of phenoxide-piperidine salt with HCl: Cleavage of the esters in the previous step leaves behind the piperidine salt and it's important to remove this for accurate loading analysis and to prevent piperidine interference in later reactions.  For 6.216mmol of resin, add 6.216mL of 2.0M HCl(aq) in approx 60mL DMF (make up the HCl/DMF solution first) and shake for 2h. Wash well with DCM, DMF, THF, ether and dry in vacuo.  Maximum loading in this case would be 0.6761mmol/g.  Yield typically: 90-100% after 2 couplings as described above.  Assessed as described below.  4. Loading analysis: To 100mg of resin (dry and accurately weighed out), add about 2mL DCM and 10 eq DIPEA then 10eq acetic anhydride, shake overnight.  Wash well with DCM, THF, Ether.  Cleave with amine of choice, eg 4-methylbenzylamine, 3 eq in DCM, 2mL overnight. Wash resin through onto a silica plug to remove excess amine and vac down to give pure amide product.  Assess yield based on the mass of product gained.  Typically 90-100%.
