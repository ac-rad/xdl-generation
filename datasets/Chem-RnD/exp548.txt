A mixture of 3-oxo-N-[4-[4-(3-oxobutanoylamino)phenyl]ethylphenyl]butanamide (300 mg, 0.789 mmol), thiourea (180 mg, 2.37 mmol), 5-bromovanilin (460 mg, 1.97 mmol) and catalytic amount of conc. HCl (4 drops) in EtOH (10 mL) was heated at reflux for 3 days. After the completion of reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool. The solid product formed was filtered, washed with water (5 mL) and cold ether (3x5 mL) and dried. The title compound was obtained as a mustard yellow coloured solid (650 mg, 89% yield).
