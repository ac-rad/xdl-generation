2,6-diacetylpyridine (1.50 g, 9.19 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (25 ml) in a 50 ml round bottom flask. To this was added 2,6-diisopropylaniline (3.50 ml, 3.25 g, 18.38 mmol, 2 eq.) and 2 drops of glacial acetic acid. The solution was heated to reflux for ca 20 h. After this time, a crude sample was taken and shown by NMR to be monosubstituted 2,6-diacetylpyridine. A further 1 ml of 2,6-diisopropylaniline was added, and reflux continued for a further 24 h. Upon cooling light yellow crystals were formed. These were collected by filtration and recrystallised from ethanol. (1.84 g, 41 %).
