A mixture of thiosalicylic acid (5.14 g, 33.34 mmol) and potassium carbonate (13.7 g, 99.13 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (75 mL) was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature.*  To the reaction mixture was added 4-fluoronitrobenzene (5.63 g, 39.9mmol) dissolved in anhydrous DMF (10 mL).  The reaction mixture was heated to 130°C for 8 hours.**  Upon cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into ice (250 g) and acidified with 6M HCl (aq) to pH=4 giving a yellow solid.***  The crude solid was washed with water and petroleum ether and then it was recrystallized in the minimum amount of methylated spirits.  The crystals produced were isolated and dried at the vacuum pump to yield 2-(4-nitrophenylthio)benzoic acid (7.33 g, 80%) as a yellow solid.
