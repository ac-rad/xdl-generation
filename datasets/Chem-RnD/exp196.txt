To a solution of PCl3 (8,7 ml, 0.10 mol) in dry ether (100 ml) at –40º C, under dry argon atmosphere, diisopropylamine (26.2 ml, 0.20 mol) was added over 1h, under vigorous stirring. During this step, temperature should not be allowed to rise, and the diisopropylamine hydrochloride precipitate that forms must not be allowed to clog the reaction mixture (more dry ether may be added, if necessary). The reaction temperature was then allowed to rise to 0º C (ice bath) and left overnight, after which the precipitate was removed via canula filtering, under dry inert atmosphere (the precipitate should be washed with dry ether, to remove most of the product). The resulting solution was concentrated through distillation under a dry atmosphere until most of the ether was removed, and the crude product was distilled in vacuo (85º C, 1 mmHg), yielding the title product as a colourless liquid (16 g, 80%).
