To a well-stirred mixture of trans-cinnamaldehyde (15 g, 1 mol.) in benzene (150 mL) at about 0 °C to -5 °C was added Triflic acid (2 ml, 0.2 mol.) in portions. After the addition of the reagent, the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 15 h. The resultant reaction mixture was cooled at 0 °C and quench with triethyl amine (approx 5-7 ml) followed by ice cold water and extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL×2). The combined organic layer dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was flash chromatographed (the eluent was pet ether) to give 20 g (92 %) of 3-phenylindene.
