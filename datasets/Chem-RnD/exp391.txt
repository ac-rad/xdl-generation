Methyl pyrazine-2-carboxylate (10.00 g, 72.40 mmol, 1 eq.) was dissolved in dry THF (200 ml) and cooled to -78°C using an acetone-dry ice bath. A suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (1.41 g, 37.23 mmol, 0.51 eq.) in dry THF (~75 ml) was added dropwise over a period of 30 min at -78°C. The reaction was stirred at -78°C for a further 15 min (turns brown in colour). Glacial acetic acid (10 ml) was added slowly to kill the reaction. The solvent was then removed using a rotary evaporator and the remaining residue was dissolved in a mixture of HCl aq. (2 M, 90 ml) and chloroform (40 ml). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (8 × 30 ml). Sodium bicarbonate (10 g) in water (20 ml) was added to the combined chloroform layers and the mixture was stirred until fizzing stopped. The layers were then separated and the chloroform layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent removed to leave an orange liquid. Mass = 3.78 g, 34.97 mmol, 48%.
