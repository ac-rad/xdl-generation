Oxalyl chloride (11ml, 0.126 moles) was added to the acid (10 ml, 0.0829 moles) in toluene (50 ml) at room temperature and stirred overnight. The solution was evaporated to about half volume (high vacumn pump) and then added to liquid ammonia in toluene at - 78 Â°C. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give the crude product. Sodium hydroxide solution (10% aqueous, 20 ml) was added to the mixture which was filtered and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (150 ml, total). The combined, washed and dried organic layers wre evaporated in vacuo.  Crude product sufficiently pure for further transformations. Yield 4.7 g, 45 %
