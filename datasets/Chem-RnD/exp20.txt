40 % aqueous glyoxal (14.7g, 0.101mol of glyoxal) in n-propanol (16 mL) and water (40 mL) was added to a solution of 2,6-diisopropylphenylamine (39.6g, 0.224mol) in n-propanol (160 mL). The mixture was heated at 70Â°C with stirring for 1h. 160 mL of water was added to the mixture. The yellow precipitate formed was collected on a frit and redissolved in the minimum of hot n-propanol. Water (200 mL) was added to reprecipitate the yellow solid. The solid was collected on a frit and dried under vacuum to yield 32.9 g of product (87% yield).
