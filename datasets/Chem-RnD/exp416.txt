1-(2-Hydroxy-1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)-3-{2-[3-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)-thioureido]-cyclohexyl}-thiourea (3.18 g, 8.46 mmol) was placed in a round bottom flask (250 mL) and conc. HCl (100 ml) was added slowly.  The solution was then heated to 95 °C for 4 hours.  The solution was then diluted to 250 mL and placed in a conical flask (500 mL). Sodium carbonate was added slowly until effervescence ceased and a white precipitate had formed.  The precipitate was then filtered and washed with water (20 mL).  The white solid was dissolved in chloroform and washed with water (2 x 10 ml).  The organic layer was then dried over magnesium sulphate and the solvent removed to leave a white solid (yield 2.20 g, 77%).
