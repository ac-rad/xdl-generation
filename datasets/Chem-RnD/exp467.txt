An oven dried 100ml three neck flask, equipped with magnetic stirrer, water condenser and nitrogen inlet was charged under nitrogen with 1.0 g (4 mmol) 4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)-benzonitrile (Fluorochem) and  50 ml of anhydrous ether. The mixture was stirred until all of the nitrile had dissolved. 1.0 g of freshly opened powdered lithium aluminum hydride was then added through a powder funnel and the mixture stirred overnight. A 10ml pressure equalized dropping funnel was then attached and the excess hydride decomposed by drop wise addition of 5 ml water over one hour. A copious white precipitate of aluminum hydroxide was then present. The precipitate was filtered off with a small Buchner funnel under water aspirator pressure and washed under vacuum with 5 ml ether. The filtrate of ether/amine was dried for one hour over 2 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate and the ether solution decanted  into a 100 ml round bottom flask. The sulfate residue was twice stirred, utilizing a glass rod, with  two 5 ml ether portions which were  each decanted and  combined with the filtrate. Ether then was removed on a rotovap (water bath ~80⁰C ) and the residue pipetted into a 2 ml conical distilling flask equipped with a short path distilling head and an oil bath. Distillation under full rotary pump vacuum (bath temperature ~150⁰), yielded 800 mg (80%) of the liquid crystalline amine, which  solidified on standing at room temperature. Yields of all liquid crystalline amines in these references are in the 70-85%  range, with losses mostly mechanical.
