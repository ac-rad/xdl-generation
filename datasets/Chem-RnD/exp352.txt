3-(1-Pyrenyl)propionic acid (0.1 g, 0.36 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (15 ml)  with stirring and placed in an ice bath (0°C) under a dinitrogen atmosphere. Thionyl chloride (0.026 ml, 0.36 mmol) was then added carefully and thereafter DMF (two drops). The reaction was left in the inert atmosphere for an hour at room temperature. The solvent was removed in vacuo and an orange crystalline solid is formed in high yield (96%).
