The carbohydrate (6-deoxy-1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-galactose) (14.9 g, 61.07 mmol, 1 equiv.) was suspended in 1 % aqueous sulfuric acid (228 mL) and the mixture heated at reflux for 3 hours (110 ºC).  The reaction mixture (now a clear and colourless solution) was allowed to cool to room temperature and neutralised (pH 7) by slow, portionwise addition of sodium hydrogen carbonate.  This followed solvent removal in vacuo (0.5 mmHg, water bath temperature below 30 ºC), and finally complete removal of all water on a freeze drier to give the crude product (16.4 g).  Further purification was not necessary, and the sugar was reprotected as the acetate (>99 % over 2 steps).
