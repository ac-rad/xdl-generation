To a solution of 5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-one (200 mg, 1.2 mmol) in DCM (4 mL) cooled to -78 Â°C was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (948 mg, 5.9 mmol).  The reaction was slowly allowed to warm to an ambient temperature over 4 h and stirring was continued for a further 24 h.  The reaction mixture was poured onto basic alumina, washed with water (5 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo.  Purification was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with petrol:ethyl acetate (10:1 v:v) as the eluent, yielding the title compound as colourless crystals (224 mg, 98 %).
