To a solution of and bromo-oxa and thio heterotricycles (1) (0.80 mmol) in dry DCM (5 mL) cooled to -78 °C under N2 was added BF3•Et2O (0.11 mL, tech 50%, 0.88 mmol) in DCM (5 mL) over 3 min. After being stirred at same temperature for 15 min, the reaction mixture was warmed to 0 °C over period of 3 h. The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for another 4 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water (5 mL) and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted with DCM (10 mL) and the combined organic layers were washed with water (2 x 4 mL), dried (anhydrous MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was subjected to flash column chromatography to afford following compounds.
