N-(3,6,9-Trioxadecyl)phthalimide (4.71 g, 16.1 mmol, 1.0 eq.)  Page 250 was taken up in EtOH (55 ml) and treated with hydrazine monohydrate (860 microliter, 17.7 mmol, 1.1 eq.). The resulting mixture was refluxed at 100 °C for 5 h, whereupon a white precipitate formed. TLC showed full conversion (Hexan-EtOAc/1 : 1, educt Rf 0.3, product Rf 0). The slurry was allowed to cool and then treated with concentrated HCl (3.85 ml), followed by refluxing again for 1 h. The slurry was allowed to cool to room temperature and the white solid was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo, the residue taken up in water (25 ml) and the solution brought to pH 11 with 1 M NaOH (16 ml). The aqueous phase was saturated with NaCl and extracted with dichloromethane (4 x 30 ml). The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4, evaporated to dryness and briefly dried at high vacuum, yielding a slightly brownish liquid. Kugelrohr distillation (0.1 Torr, heating chamber at 110 °C) gave the title compound as colorless liquid (1.61 g, 9.88 mmol, 61%).
