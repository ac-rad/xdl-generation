A solution of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylether (0.998 mmol, 200 mg) in MeOH (7 mL) was treated with benzaldehyde (1.99 mmol, 0.20 mL), a solution of cyclohexyl isocyanide (1.99 mmol, 0.24 mL) in MeOH (3 mL), and trichloroacetic acid (1.99 mmol, 326 mg) in the order given. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 28 hours, and then filtered. The precipitate was washed with first Et2O and then with n-hexane to remove unreacted reagents or by-products and dried to give white Ugi adduct (640 mg, 70%). m.p. 248-251°C, Rf(50%EtOAc/n-hexane): 0.82
