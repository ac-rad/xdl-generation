A 10% (w/v) solution of KOH in water (200 mL) was added to a solution of retinyl palmitate (10.5 g, 20.0 mmol) in propan-2-ol (100 mL) and ethanol (100 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux at 90 °C for 75 min, then it was poured into ice water (0.5 L) and extracted with hexanes (2×350 mL). Combined organic layers were subsequently washed with water (300 mL) and brine (300 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After filtration and evaporation, the residue was chromatographed on silica (60/200, 250 mL) in EtOAc – hexanes mixture (10 to 20% EtOAc) to yield retinol (3.28 g, 58%) as an orange viscous oil that solidified after several days at –20 °C.
