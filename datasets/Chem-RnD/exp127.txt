The alcohol (227mg, 1mmol) in DCM (1mL) is added to a stirred solution of PDC (1.5g, 4mmol) and molecular sieves (spatula full) in DCM (2mL)and the reaction is stirred until completion (TLC, about 24 hours), then filtered through celite and concentrated in vacuum.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 5%EtOAc/PE to give a yellow oil (170mg, 75%).
