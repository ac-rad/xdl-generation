To HCl (37%, N2 saturated, 70ml) in a large Schlenk flask was added 2,4-pentanedione (18.2ml, 0.96mol) in one portion. Nitrogen was bubbled through the mixture for five minutes and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmosphere before cooling with an ice bath. Phenylphosphine (7ml, 0.064mmol) was added slowly via a syringe (Care: Phenylphosphine is spontaneously flammable in air and has incredibly pungent odour). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 days. Water (70ml) was added and the white precipitate collected and washed with water (100ml) before drying under vacuum. 13g (70%) of a white solid was collected.
