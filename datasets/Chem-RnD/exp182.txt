Synthesis of ethylpiperidine hypophosphite: A solution of aqueous hypophosphorous acid (50% w/w) was dried in vacuo at 50°C (~7 mmHg) with good stirring. After complete removal of the water, the acid was placed under an inert atmosphere (N2) and cooled to 0°C. 1-Ethylpiperidine (1 eqv.) was added to the acid at 0°C, whilst stirring slowly to precipitate out a white salt (hygroscopic). The reaction proceeds in quantitative yield. This salt was used without any further purification as a reagent. Hydrodehalogenation procedure: To a solution of the organohalide (1 eqv.) in dry 1,4-dioxane or toluene (20 mL per mmol of the organohalide), was added EPHP (10 eqv.) and AIBN (0.05 eqv.) in one portion under an inert atmosphere (N2). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux and monitored by TLC, until all starting material had been consumed (3-24 h). The reaction was allowed to cool, then quenched with water and extracted with EtOAc (x4). All the organic extracts were combined, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified by column chromatography or by direct recrystallisation.
