To a deoxygenated solution of iodide (10 g, 33 mmol, 1 equiv.) in DMF (62 mL) cooled to 0°C was added diisopropylethyl amine (6.4 g, 49 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) and TMS acetylene (3.2 g, 33 mmol, 1 equiv.).  The reaction mixture was seen to lighten in colour (orange to yellow).  Copper iodide (280 mg, 1.48 mmol, 4.5 mol %) and Pd(PPh3)4 (758 mg, 0.66 mmol, 2 mol %) were added and stirring continued overnight at 0°C.  The reaction was quenched with NH4Cl solution (40 mL) and extracted into ether (5 x 120 mL).  The combined organics were washed with water (20 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo leaving a brown oil.  Purification of this oil was achieved by chromatography on silica gel with petrol:ether (20:1 v:v) a the eluent yielding the title product as a yellow oil (6.84 g, 76 %).
