EXAMPLE 7: <br/>MOLECULE CL481 <br/>(S)-Methyl 2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-6-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)hexanoate: <br/>To a solution of Z-L-Lys(Boc)OH (5.00 g, 13.1 mmol) in dry DMF (100 mL) was added CsCO<sub>3</sub> (2.36 g, 0.26 mmol). <br/>The mixture was stirred at RT for 2H00. <br/>To the reaction mixture was then added dropwise methyl iodide (980 μL, 15.77 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at RT overnight. <br/>The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (100 mL) and washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution water and brine. <br/>The organic layer was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. <br/>The crude compound was purified on column of silica gel (2percent MeOH/DCM) to give the subject compound (5.00 g, yield 96percent). <br/>Intermediate 26 was characterized by the following spectroscopic data: <sup>1</sup>H NMR (DMSO-d6, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 7.47 (m, 5H), 6.76 (t, 1H), 5.09 (s, 2H), 4.51 (m, 1H), 3.68 (s, 3H), 3.18 (m, 2H), 1.90 (m, 2H), 1.55 (m, 2H), 1.38 (s, 9H), 1.25 (m, 2H).
