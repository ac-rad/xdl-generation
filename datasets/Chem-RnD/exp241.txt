A mixture of propionyl chloride (1.0 g, 10.8 mmol, 1 eq.), paraformaldehyde (0.36 g, 11.8 mmol) stirred at room temperature and catalytic amount of anhydrous zinc chloride (Lewis acid) (0.147 g, 1.08 mmol) was added. After 30 min of addition reaction mixture was heated at 100-110°C for 7 h. The crude product distilled at b.p. 55-60°C /40 mmHg to yield pure product chloromethyl propionate as a colorless liquid (0.9 g, 68%).
