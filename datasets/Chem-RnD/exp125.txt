The reagents are mixed together (in order listed), and stirred in a stoppered flask for 24 hours at room temperature.  Saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution is added until there is no more effervescence (~200 ml).  The organic layer is separated, and concentrated.  The crystals are dissolved in ether, dried and concentrated, then recrystallised (40/60 Petrol). Yield: 8.81 g; 80%.
