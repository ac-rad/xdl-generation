To 2-tert­-butyl-5-methylphenol (16.5 g, 0.10 mol) in dry acetonitrile (500 ml) under argon was added dry TEA (55 ml), followed by dry MgCl2 (14.4 g, 0.15 mol). The mixture was stirred for 30 min. Dry paraformaldehyde (21 g, 0.70 mol) was added, and the mixture was heated at reflux for 2 h, before being allowed to cool to rt. The product was extracted with Et2O (7 × 100 ml), dried (MgSO4) and filtered through celite. The solvent was then removed in vacuo. Distillation under reduced pressure (125 – 150 °C) yielded the desired product as a yellow-green oil (3.8 g, 18%).
