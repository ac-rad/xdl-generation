TsNa is dissolved in water and filtered to obtain a clear solution. Bromine is added dropwise over about 30min with rapid stirring and venting to allow for build-up of bromine gas. A yellow precipitate of crude TsBr is observed. Mixture is stirred for a further 30min following complete addition of the bromine. Filter off the crude TsBr and wash well with water. Dry thoroughly in vacuo overnight. Typical crude yield of dry powdery solid, 63-69%. Recrystallisation from carbon tetrachloride First dissolve in minimum hot CCl4 and hot filter to remove any insoluble oily solid. Allow to cool and filter off crystals of TsBr. Wash with very cold CCl4 (-20Â°C) Do not air dry for more than a few seconds or crystals will go off. Final overall yield approx 50%
