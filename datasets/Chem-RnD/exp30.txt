Finely powdered 3-methylcatechol diacetate (25 g, 0.12 mol) and ground aluminium chloride (16.0 g, 0.12 mol) were mixed and heated to 90 °C for 5 minutes. The temperature was then raised to 120 °C and maintained at that temperature for 25 minutes. The resulting brown solid was allowed to cool and quenched by the addition of dilute HCl (200 mL) and extracted into dichloromethane (3 x 200 mL). The combined extracts were dried (MgSO4), filtered and the solvent removed from the filtrate in vacuo. The crude product was recrystallised from petrol to yield the acetophenone as a white solid (3.6 g, 22 mmol, 18%).
