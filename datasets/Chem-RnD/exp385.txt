Dimethylformamide (30 mL), 2,5-dichlorobenzene (9.6 g, 0.05 mole), ethyl cyanoacetate (6.2 g, 0.055 mol) are charged to a 100 mL round bottomed flask. To this tetrabutylammonium bromide(0.5 g, 5% by weight to dichloronitrobenzene) was added, followed by powder potassium carbonate (7.6 g, 0.055 mol) all at once and stirred at room temperature (25-35 Â°C) for 16 hours. Reaction mixture turns dark red in 10-15 min. TLC shows complete disappearance of 2,5-dichloronitrobenzene after about 15 h. The reaction mixture diluted with ethylacetate (200 mL) and added into water (200 mL). The reaction mixture was acidified to about pH 6 with dilute HCl. At this time the dark red color turns to light yellow. Water layer was separated and discarded. Ethyl acetate was given water wash and dried over sodium sulphate( 25-30 g). The ethyl acetate layer thus obtained was concentrated to get the condensed product as a viscous oil - 12.8 g. This is purified by column chromatography using petroleum ether: ethyl acetate (97:3) on silica gel to get 10.7 g (79%)
