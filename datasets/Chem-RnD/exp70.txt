TBTH (0.9 ml, 3.3 mmoles) was added to a stirred solution of the alcohol (498 mg, 3.3 mmoles) and  AIBN (57 mg, 0.35 mmoles) in benzene (5 ml) and heated for one hour. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature (reaction monitored by tlc). The solvent removed in vacuo and the crude product dissolved in CH2Cl2 (5 ml) and iodine added at room temperature.The reaction mixture was stirred until complete by tlc (few hours to overnight).  The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (50 ml) and the organic layer washed with saturated sodium thiosulphate solution (3 x 20 ml), brine (3 x 20 ml) and dried over sodium sulfate.Purification by  silica-gel chromatography (petrol: ether, 20:1, 15:1, 10:1, then 5:1). Partial seperation of isomers achieved (373mg, 40%) then mixture (83 mg, 9%) then 35 mg, 6%).
