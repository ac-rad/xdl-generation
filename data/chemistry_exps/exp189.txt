To a 500ml conical flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was added a solution of sodium hydroxide (4.72 g, 0.118 mol, 2.5 eqv.) in water (47 mL). Ethanol (33 mL) was added with stirring and the solution was cooled by an ice-water bath. To the resultant solution, benzaldehyde (5 g, 0.047 mol, 1 eqv.) and analytical grade acetone (1.36 g, 0.023 mol, 0.5 eqv.) were added slowly over 15 minutes. On complete addition, the mixture was stirred for one hour at room temperature. A yellow solid appeared slowly, and after a further hour it was filtered in vacuo and then washed with ether (3 x 50 mL). The solid material could be purified by flash chromatography using petroleum ether 40-60Â°C/ethyl acetate (4/1, v/v) to afford dibenzylidene acetone as a yellow solid (3.98 g, 74 %) or recrystallised from CH2Cl2.
