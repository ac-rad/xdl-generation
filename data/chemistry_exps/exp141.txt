Pentane-2,4-dione (10.01 g; 0.1 mol), phenylacetaldehyde (12.0 g; 0.1 mol) and piperidine (0.1 g) were stirred for 24 hours.  DCM (100 cm3) was added, and the mixture washed with 5% HCl (50 cm3) and water (50 cm3), then dried and concentrated to give 3-styrylpentane-2,4-dione.  Column chromatography (PE/EtOAc) gave pure product (3.80 g; 19%).
3-Styrylpentane-2,4-dione (0.80 g; 3.96 mmol) and zinc acetate dihydrate (0.02 g) were refluxed in methanol (2 cm3) for 24 hours.  Bulb to bulb distillation yielded 1-phenylpent-1-en-4-one (60 Â°C @ 0.04 mmHg) as a pale yellow oil (0.41 g; 65%).
