Freshly distilled 1-ethylimidazole (79.6 g, 828 mmol) was diluted with dry toluene (300 ml) in a three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a dropping funnel, thermometer and nitrogen line. Freshly distilled dimethyl sulfate (100.7 g, 798 mmol) was added dropwise over seven hours, under a nitrogen atmosphere, taking care to ensure the temperature of the reaction mixture did not exceed 30 Â°C. During the dropwise addition, a biphasic solution formed. The solution was stirred at room temperature overnight, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The layers were separated, and the lower layer was washed with toluene (3 x 25 ml). The ionic liquid was dried under high vacuum to yield 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate (171.1 g, 96%) as a colourless viscous liquid.
