Oxazepam (10 g, 34.87 mmol) was added to xylene (50 mL) in a 250 mL Dean-Stark apparatus under nitrogen atmosphere. Reaction mixture was refluxed and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to 5-8 °C and the white crystals thus obtained was filtered and dried under vacuum for 6 h at 70-75 °C to get 6-Chloro-4-phenyl-2-quinazoline carboxaldehyde as white crystalline product (8.9 g, 96 %) which is practically pure and does not require further purification.
