The alcohol (1.02 g, 5.99 mmol, 1 equiv.) and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid (1.35 g, 7.12 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) were dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (30 mL/mmol) and dry dichloromethane (30 mL/mmol) and the solution cooled to 0 ºC.  1,3-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (1.60 g, 7.79 mmol, 1.3 equiv.) was added, in portions, over 30 minutes and the solution allowed to stir at 0 ºC for 5 minutes.  The resulting suspension was filtered through celite and the solvent reduced in vacuo.  Purification by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 5 : 1) yielded the desired product as a white solid (2.01 g, 99%).
