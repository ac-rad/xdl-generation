4-Nitrobenzyl bromide (0.94 g, 4.3 mmole) was added to an excess of trimethyl phosphite (10.52 g,  89 mmol).  While stirring, NaOH (1 mL of 12.5M) was added dropwise to the solution.  After stirring for 24 hours at room temperature, the solution was filtered to yield 1,4-nitrobenzylphosphonic acid as a yellow-beige solid, which was recrystallized in ethyl ether to yield glassy crystals (0.54 g;  70.5%).
