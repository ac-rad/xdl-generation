p-nitrobenzyl glyoxylate (1.215g, 6 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM (15 mL) and the reaction vessel was cooled to 0Â°C. Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (1.356g, 1.20 mL, 9.6 mmol) was then introduced and allyltrimethylsilane (1.043g, 1.45 mL, 9.1 mmol) was added to the solution 1/2 hr later. After 1 hr the reaction was warmed to room temp. and left to stir overnight. The reaction was washed with water ( 3 x 20 mL), dried (MgSO4) and filtered and concentrated. The orange oil was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with 3:2 petrol-EtOAc, to give 2-hydroxy-pent-4-enoic acid 4-nitro benzyl ester (1.177g, 5.5 mmol, 78%) as an orange oil.
