A 50 ml 3 neck round bottom flask, equipped with water condenser, heating mantle,  dropping funnel, nitrogen inlet, magnetic stirrer, and calcium chloride drying tube, was charged under nitrogen with 4.75g (0.019 mole) 4-bromophenyl maleic anhydride, 12ml (~ 0.09 mole) trimethylsilyl azide, and 3 ml dry dioxane. A rubber tube exiting the water condenser  lead to a one liter water filled inverted graduate cylinder in a water trough, allowing for easy monitoring of nitrogen evolution.The mixture was refluxed 3 hrs after which nitrogen gas evolution ceased. TLC (silica gel, ethyl acetate eluent) showed primarily the 4- isomer with traces of the 5-isomer. The solution was cooled in ice to 0 °C and 40 ml toluene was added with stirring. Addition of 1 ml ethanol gave a copious white precipitate which TLC showed to be pure 4-isomer. The precipitate was suction filtered and mother liquor concentrated further, giving 2.9g (58%),  4-(4-bromophenyl)-1,3(3H) oxazine-2,6-dione in three crops. Recrystallization of a small sample from ethyl acetate gave white crystals,
