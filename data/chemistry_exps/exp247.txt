Anhydrous DMF (15 mL) was added to sodium saccharine (20.0g, 98 mmoles) in a round bottom flask, under a balloon of nitrogen, and stirred at 1200C for 15 minutes to give a white suspension. Methyl chloroacetate (98 mmoles) was then added dropwise and the resulting clear solution stirred for a further 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then poured over crushed ice. The resulting white precipitate was filtered under suction, washed with excess cold water and dried to yield the product as a white solid. Yield: 23.2g, 94%
