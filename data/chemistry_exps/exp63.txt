The carbohydrate (3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl nitrate) (230.2 mg, 0.612 mmol, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in distilled acetonitrile (2.3 mL) and lithium bromide (267.2 mg, 3.08 mmol, 5 equiv.) was added (under nitrogen and protected from light).  The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 15 hours before it was diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and extracted with water (2 x 10 mL).  Drying over sodium sulfate and solvent evaporation in vacuo gave the crude product which, after purification by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether (40-60Â°)/ethyl acetate, 5:1), gave the desired product as a colourless oil (238.2 mg, >99 %).
