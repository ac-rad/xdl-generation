The carbohydrate (2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-a-D-galactopyranosyl-1-bromide) (17.2 g, 0.05 mol, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in acetic acid (9.5 mL, 0.16 mol, 3 equiv.) and hydrobromic acid (39 mL of a 30 wt.% solution in acetic acid, 0.20 mol, 3.7 equiv.) was added at room temperature (under nitrogen and protected from light).  The reaction mixture was left to stir for 1½ hours after which the mixture was cooled to 0 °C and dichloromethane (300 mL) was added followed by slow addition of ice-cold water (100 mL).  The two layers were separated and the organic fraction further washed with cold water (50 mL) and cold dilute aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 50 mL).  Drying over sodium sulfate and solvent removal in vacuo (water bath temperature below 30 °C to avoid decomposition) yielded the desired compound as an orange oil (17.0 g, 93 %).
