To a round bottomed flask was added 2-hydroxy-9H-thioxanthen-​9-​one (0.46 g, 2 mmol), DCM (20 mL) and 4-toluenesulphonyl chloride (0.95 g, 5 mmol).*  The solution was lowered into an slush bath** and with constant stirring, triethylamine (1.01 g, 10 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 5 minutes.***  Upon the total addition of triethylamine, the solution was allowed to stir for 90 minutes at room temperature.  The reaction mixture was poured into a separating funnel and DCM (50 mL) was added.  The organic layer was washed with 2M hydrochloric acid (100 mL), the organic layer was isolated, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The solid was recrystallised from hot toluene to yield 2-​tosyloxy-9H-thioxanthen-​9-​one (0.61 g, 80%) as yellow flakes.
