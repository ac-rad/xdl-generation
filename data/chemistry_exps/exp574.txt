A three-necked round bottomed flask equipped with condenser and stir bar was dried in an oven at 130째C overnight, then quickly sealed with three septa and actively purged with nitrogen gas for 20 minutes. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (24 mL) and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzene (0.206 g, 0.285 mmol, 1 eq.) were added to the flask under nitrogen and the flask was cooled to -78째C in a dewar of dry ice/acetone. N-butyllithium (0.599 mL, 1.2 mmol, 4.2 eq.) was added drop-wise and the reaction was stirred for 15 minutes before warming to 0째C. After monitoring the reaction by TLC (10% ethyl acetate/hexanes, starting material Rf = 0.64, lithiated intermediate Rf = 0.51) to ensure the lithiation was complete (~30 min.), the reaction was then cooled down to -78째C again and dimethylformamide (0.3 mL, 3.87 mmol, 14 eq.) was added to quench. The quench with DMF was monitored through TLC of the reaction mixture (10% ethyl acetate/hexanes; product does not move off baseline). When the DMF had reacted (~1 hr.), the reaction was quenched with water. The tetrahydrofuran was evaporated off and the residue was dissolved in methylene chloride and washed with water and brine. The organic layer was then dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The suspension was taken up in hot methanol, cooled and vacuum filtered through a Buchner funnel to yield the product as a yellow-orange powder (0.090 g, 0.174 mmol, 61% yield).
