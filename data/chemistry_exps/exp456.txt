(R)-phenylglycinol (1 g, 7.3 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL) and was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of NaH (0.36 g, 14.9 mmol, 2.05 eq) in dry THF (10 mL) under an inert atmosphere. The solution was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. 1-(bromomethyl)-4-fluorobenzene (0.96 mL, 1.46 g, 7.7 mmol, 1.05 eq) was added drop-wise over 5 min and the solution was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. At this point, the solution was heated to reflux (65 째C) under partial vacuum for 3 h before cooling to ambient temperature. This was followed by the addition of brine (40 mL). The product was extracted with diethyl ether(4 x 60 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed to give a pale yellow oil. This crude product was purified by two K체gelrohr distillations; first at 125 째C (under high vacuum) to remove unreacted starting material, and the second at 185 째C (under high vacuum) to give the product, a faint yellow oil.Yield: 0.386 g (22%)
