A solution of NaOH (0.902 g, 22.55 mmol, 1.6 eq) in distilled water (40 mL) at room temperature was added to a stirred solution of benzaldehyde (4.361 g, 41.13 mmol, 2.9 eq) in ethanol (40 mL). Acetone (0.833 g, 14.36 mmol, 1.0 eq) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The precipitated product was recovered by suction filtration, washed 1x with 2-3mL of 1:1 ethanol/water, dried over suction for 25 minutes, and recovered (3.044 g, 90.6%) as yellow crystals (mp 103-104Â°C).
