Pyridine-2,6-dicarbonyl dichloride (1.0 g, 4.8 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (20 ml) under argon. S-(+)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine (1.08 ml, 10.2 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Dry TEA (~6 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The mixture was then washed with water (3 Ã— 20 ml) and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was recrystallised from DCM/pentane. Yield 1.2 g (78%).
