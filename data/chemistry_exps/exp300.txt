A solution of 4-(methylsulfanyl)-1,2-benzoquinone (prepared by nitrosodisulfonate oxidation of 4-(methylmercapto)phenol, 1.0 g, 7.1 mmol) in CHCl3 (150 cm3) was shaken with a solution of Na2S2O4 (6 g) and Na2HPO4 (2.2 g) in water (30 cm3). The red quinone was rapidly decolourised. The CHCl3 was separated, dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to give a residue which was flash chromatographed on silica gel 60 (50 g) eluting with ethyl acetate â€“ cyclohexane. Evaporation of the appropriate fractions gave the product as a cream solid (42% based on 4-(methylmercapto)phenol).
