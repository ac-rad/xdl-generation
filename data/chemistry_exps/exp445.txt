To a stirred solution of morpholine (0.958 g, 11.0 mmol) and triethylamine (1.260 g, 12.0 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) at ambient temperature was carefully added benzoyl chloride (1.406 g, 10.0 mol) at a sufficiently slow rate that boiling of the solvent is minimized. The viscous dark reaction mixture was stirred for a further 1 h before water (20 mL) was added. The dichloromethane extracts (3 x 10 mL) were washed with water (4 x 15 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate. The volatiles were removed under pressured to leave an off-white product. (1.82 g, 95 %).
