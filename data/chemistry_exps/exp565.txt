To a round bottom flask was added 2-nitrophenylamine (2.14g, 10 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (30mL).  The solution was lowered into a slush bath and with constant stirring, zinc dust was added gradually (13.0 g, 200 mmol).*  Upon the total addition of zinc dust, the reaction was removed from the slush bath and stirred at room temperature for two hours.  The solution was poured over celite at the pump and the cake was washed with glacial acetic acid (10mL).
The freshly filtered solution was added to a mixture of alloxan monohydrate (1.59g, 10mmol) and boric acid (0.92g, 15mmol).  The mixture was stirred for three hours, to produce a yellow crude precipitate which was isolated at the pump and washed with diethyl ether to yield 10-phenylisoalloxazine (2.74 g, 94%) as a bright yellow solid which was dried in vacuo.
