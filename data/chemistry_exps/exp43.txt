To a solution of 2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylacetophenone (0.5 g, 3.0 mmol) in acetone (30 mL), was added powdered potassium hydroxide (0.34 g, 6.0 mmol) and dimethylsulfate (0.57 mL, 0.76 g, 6.0 mmol). The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 hours then water (50 mL) was added and the reaction extracted into ether (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (50% Ether / Petrol) to yield the product as a yellow oil (0.62 g, 3.0 mmol, 100%).
