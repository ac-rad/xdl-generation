In a 1000 mL Parr reaction vessel, 1-ethylimidazole (43.15 g, 449 mmol) (Note 1) was added to dimethylcarbonate (95 g, 1055 mmol) with 290 mL of methanol. The reactor was sealed and heated at 140°C for 25 hours in the circular heater resulting in 298.35 g of a pale yellow liquid. The conversion of ethylimidazole was complete (Note 2). 
 The 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methylcarbonate (100.46 g, 27.9 g of [C2C1im][MeCO3], 150 mmol, in methanol) was dried over 3Å molecular sieves for 72 hours (Note 3). The methanol was then removed by stirring the solution in a dry 250 mL three-neck flask under vacuum at 45°C in a glycerol bath. The viscous, dark brown remaining liquid gave 22.55 g of a mustard yellow solid upon cooling at room temperature under vacuum. The solid was then recrystallized (Note 4) three times under nitrogen using dry acetonitrile (0.5 mL of solvent for 1 g of solid) (Note 5). The first time a brief quench in a dry ice and acetone bath was needed to quicken the crystallization, but the subsequent times cooling at room temperature was sufficient. After each recrystallization the solvent was removed via canula under nitrogen and the remaining solid was washed with 3*10 mL of dry acetonitrile under nitrogen. After 24 hours under vacuum at 45°C, the solid (off-white crystals) was weighed inside a glovebox (6.42 g). Total yield from 1-ethylimidazole : 28%.
