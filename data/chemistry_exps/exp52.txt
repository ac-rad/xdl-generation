A solution of bromine (136.9 g, 0.86 mol) in methanol (239 mL) was slowly added via addition funnel to a stirred solution of furfuryl alcohol (70.4 g, 0.718 mol) in dry diethyl ether (239 mL) and methanol (239 mL) maintaining an internal temperature between –35 °C and –45 °C.  Upon addition completion, stirring was continued for a further 2 hours at reduced temperature.  The resulting light yellow solution was saturated with gaseous ammonia to pH 8 and allowed to warm to an ambient temperature.  The resulting yellow suspension was filtered, removing ammonium bromide and concentrated in vacuo.  Further filtration removed the white solid formed upon concentration of the yellow oil.  The oil was diluted in benzene (500 mL) and filtered through neutral alumina.  Evaporation of the solvent yielded a yellow oil (102.6 g, 90.4 %) which was seen to be of sufficient purity further reactivity
