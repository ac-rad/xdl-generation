A mixture of ephedrine hydrate (5.2 g, 0.03 mole) and carbonyldiimidazole (16 g) in THF (100 ml) was heated under reflux for 7h. The THF was distilled off in a current of steam, ice and water added, the mixture stirred, and then the solid which separated was filtered off and dried in a vacuum desiccator to afford the colourless solid product (4.55 g, 79%) .
