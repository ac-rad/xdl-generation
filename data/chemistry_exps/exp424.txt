(S)-Alaninol (2.0 g, 26.6 mmol) was dissolved in aqueous NaOH solution (50 ml, 1 M) and was cooled in an ice/water bath. A solution of di-tert-butyldicarbonate (6.5 g, 30.0 mmol) in dioxane (30 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. The mixture was then allowed to separate. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH ≈ 8 using a saturated NH4Cl solution and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 30 ml). The organic layer and ethyl acetate extracts were combined and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was extracted with ethyl acetate/hexane (1:2) mixture, filtered and the solvent were removed under reduced pressure. The obtained product was used in the subsequent step without further purification. Yield 3.3 g (71%).
