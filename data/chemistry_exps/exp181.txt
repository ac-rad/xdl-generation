The enediyne is dissolved in DCM (2 mL), freshly activated molecular sieves added and the mixture stirred under nitrogen for 1 hour.  Meanwhile to further freshly activated molecular sieves stirring in DCM (1.5 mL) at -18C is added the titanium tetraisopropoxide and the diethyl tartrate.  This mixture is stirred for 1 hour then the TBHP added, folowed by the endiyne via canula.  The mixture is allowed to warm to 0C and stirred for 15 hours then quenched with trimethylphosphite (1 mL) then 10% aqueous tartaric acid (2 mL) added.  The organics are extracted 3 times with ether then washed with sodium bicarbonate solution and brine then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.  Column chromatography eluting with 5% ether/PE affords the product as a yellow oil (0.038g, 69%)
