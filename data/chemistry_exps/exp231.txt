(1,5-cyclooctadiene)bis(pyridine)iridium(I) hexafluorophosphate (2). To an oven-dried vial equipped with a stir bar was added solid dichloro-bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)diiridium(I) (1) (66.7 mg, 0.099 mmol) and 3.0 mL of degassed 1:1 acetone/water.  Neat pyridine (0.11 mL, 1.37 mmol) was added, followed by solid potassium hexafluorophosphate (55.9 mg, 0.30 mmol) in a single portion.  The reaction mixture immediately turned from dark orange to bright yellow, and the solution was stirred at room temperature under argon for 2.5 hours.  The acetone was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum to afford (2) as a bright yellow solid (80.7 mg, 67%).  

Crabtree's catalyst (3).  To a flame-dried 25 mL flask under argon was added a solution of (2) (80.7 mg, 0.13 mmol) in 5.0 mL of dry, degassed methanol.  A solution of tricyclohexylphosphine (45.0 mg, 0.16 mmol) in 0.5 mL diethyl ether was added, and the reaction mixture immediately turned from yellow to orange.  After stirring at room temperature under argon for 45 minutes, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give an orange solid.  The crude product was washed with two 4.0 mL portions of chilled diethyl ether and dried under high vacuum to give (3) as an orange solid (107.6 mg, 99%).
