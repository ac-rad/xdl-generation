A mixture of 6-bromoisatin (1.0 g, 4.4 mmol) and PCl5 (1.0 g, 4.8 mmol) in chlorobenzene (30 cm3) was heated under N2 at 98 – 102 °C for 4 h. After cooling the brown solution, indoxyl acetate (716 mg, 4.2 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to stand overnight. The violet reaction mixture was diluted with ethanol (30 cm3), filtered, and the residue washed with ethanol (2 x 30 cm3) to give a dark blue solid (309 mg), which was recrystallized from ethyl benzoate (100 cm3), washing with ethanol (25 cm3) then ethanol – diethyl ether (1:1, 25 cm3), to give a black solid with a coppery lustre (282 mg, 20% yield).
