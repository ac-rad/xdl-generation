General procedure: MW : 514.07 Formula : C31H32C1N302 LCMS : 100, MH<sup>+</sup>=515 1H NMR (250 MHz, DMSo-d6) δ ppm 9.07 (s, 1H), 7.57-7.18 (m, 5H), 7.17-6.55 (m, 7H), 6.43-6.22 (m, 2H), 3.58-3.38 (m, 1H), 3.29-3.14 (m, 3H), 3.11-2.24 (m, 4H), 1.79 (s, 3H), 0.97 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 6H) A mixture of 600mg (1.27mmol) of Compound 7, 232μ (2.54mmol) of anhydride acetic, 415μ (5.08mmol) of pyridine in l OmL of DCM, in a sealed reaction vessel, was heated under microwave conditions for 15min at 100Â°C. After cooling a precipitate was formed upon addition of Et20, it was then filtered off and washed with Et20 to give 450mg (69percent) of Compound 8 as beige powder.
