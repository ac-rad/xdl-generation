Ethylene sulfide (3.2 cm3, 0.053 mol) was added to a magnetically stirred mixture of 4-mercaptophenol (6.3 g, 0.05 mol) and Et3N (3 drops) heated on a water bath at 40 – 45 ºC over a period of 1 h. After the addition was complete heating was continued for a further 0.5 h. The product was distilled, b.p. 100 – 120 ºC/0.01 mm, to give a colourless oil (4.0 g, 43%).
