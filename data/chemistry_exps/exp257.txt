p-Nitro phenyl alanine (20g, 0.095mol) was placed in a 500 ml 4-neck rbf then charged with acetic acid (200ml). Succinic anhydride (10.4g, 0.104mol) was added and then heated to 100110ËšC for 6-8h with continuous stirring. The reaction was monitored by TLC (solvent system: 40% methanol/DCM and 12 drops aqueous ammonia). The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, poured slowly onto ice-cold water (500ml) and then poured onto methylene chloride (100ml)in a separating funnel. The organic layer was extracted with DCM and the solvent removed in vacuo. Isopropyl alcohol (50ml) was added to the resultant gum and stirred for 2-3hrs after which the red colored solid product was observed. The product was filtered through a sinter funnel and washed with IPA (2 x 10ml) and dried under vacuum for 4hrs. Yield: 15g (54%).
