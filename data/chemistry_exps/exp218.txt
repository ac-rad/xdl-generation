A mixture of the methyl ester (0.132 g; 0.3 mmol) and trimethyltin hydroxide (0.300 g; 1.7 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (3 mL) was heated in a sealed vial under microwave conditions at 120 Â°C for 0.5 h, (with cooling air on). The cooled mixture was allowed to stand until a precipitate formed, then filtered, concentrated in vacuo and purified by column chromatography (EtOAc) to yield the carboxylic acid (0.051 g; 39%)
