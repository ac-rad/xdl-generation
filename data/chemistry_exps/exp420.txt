Methanesulfonyl chloride (0.32 ml, 4.12 mmol) and TEA (0.57 ml, 4.12 mmol) were added to a solution of (R)-2-(2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (1.0 g, 3.7 mmol) in DCM (20 ml) and were stirred overnight. The resulting solution was washed with water (3 Ã— 20 ml) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. Yield 1.22 g (94%).
