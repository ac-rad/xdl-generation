The diyne is stirred in THF under anhydrous conditions and the ethynyl magnesium bromide is added.  The reaction is then heated at reflux until completion (TLC, about 16 hours), then quenched with ammonium chloride solution, extracted 3 times with ether, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 30-50%EtOAc/PE.  Yields of about 70% are obtainable.
