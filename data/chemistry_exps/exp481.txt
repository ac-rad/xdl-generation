To the solution of indole (100 mg, 1 mmol) in anhydrous toluene (5 ml) at 0 °C was added acetyl chloride (121 µl, 2 mmol). After stirring for 15 minutes at 0 °C, a solution of tin(IV) chloride (197 µl, 2 mmol) in 3 ml anhydrous toluene was added. The resultant solution was further stirred for another 2 h at 0 °C,  followed by addition of 8 ml of 8% NaHCO3 solution (dropwise). This reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 ml X 3), and combined organic layer was evaporated on rotary evaporator. Purification by silica gel column chromatography (mesh 100-200) using EtOAc-hexane (2: 98 to 15: 85) as mobile phase gave 3-acetylindole as a brick red solid (118 mg, 95% yield). The product was characterized by comparison of TLC of the product (Rf 0.5 in EtOAc: n-hexane- 1: 1) with commercially available sample (CAS Number 703-80-0; Sigma Aldrich: Catalog no. A16807). It was also confirmed by comparison of NMR data with literature values (Guchhait, S. K.; Kashyap, M.; Kamble, H. J. Org. Chem. 2011, 76, 4753-4758. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo200561f)
