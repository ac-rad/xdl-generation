A 250 ml round bottom flask with heating mantle, magnetic stirrer and water condenser was charged with 8.0 g (0.0293 mol) 3-bromophenyl succinic acid, 3.5 g (0.0310 mol) selenium dioxide and 70 ml acetic anhydride. A rubber tube ran from the top of the water condenser to a 1 l beaker charged with 500 ml commercial Chlorox. The mixture was refluxed for 22 h, the reduced selenium dioxide salts were filtered off with a water aspirator and sintered glass funnel. The filtrate was concentrated to 40 ml on a rotovap in hot 80ºC water. Cooling in ice to 0º C gave a copious tan precipitate, which was suction filtered a sintered glass funnel under water aspirator pressure. The filtrate was washed three times with 5 ml portions of 50/50 ether/hexane. Drying in a vacuum desicator blue Drierite desicant under pump vacuum (~2 torr) for 4 h gave 4.75 g (64.2%) 4-Bromophenyl maleic anhydride, as tan crystals. The product is suitable for futher reactions at this point but still has a slight odor. Recrystalization from hot hexane yieldded 2.82g of odor free product, Other runs gave yields in the 60-70% range.
