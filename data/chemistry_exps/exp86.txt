The alcohol (in this case a cyclopentenone) is stirred in dichloromethane at 0 °C and the TBS-Cl is added in one portion.  The solution is stirred for 30 minutes, then the imidazole is added, and the reaction is stirred at 0 °C until all the starting material is consumed (TLC, 4-5 hours).  The reaction is then quenched with sodium bicarbonate solution, extracted with ether, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 50% Et2O/PE (only a short column should be required).
