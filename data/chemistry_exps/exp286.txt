Triethyl phosphite (10 ml) was added dropwise over 15 min to a solution of 4,5-ethylenedithio-1,3-diselenol-2-one (0.3 g, 0.99 mmol) in dry toluene (30 ml) under argon. The mixture was heated to reflux for 2 h and then allowed to cool. The product was collected by filtration and recrystallised from hot anhydrous carbon disulfide under argon (CAUTION - CS2 has a very low flash point and is highly inflammable). Yield 0.15 g (52%).
