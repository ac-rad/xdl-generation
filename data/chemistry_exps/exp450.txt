Hydrated nickel (II) tetrafluoroborate (10.21 g, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in dry acetonitrile (13 cm3) and ethyl orthoformate (36.0 g, 0.24 mmol) was added. The resulting blue solution was heated to reflux under argon for 1 h and all volatiles removed in vacuo. The purple solid was taken up in dry acetonitrile (15 cm3), layered with diethyl ether (20 cm3) and stored at 4ÂºC overnight. The purple microcrystalline precipitate formed was isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo for several hours. The compound was analysed by melting point and IR, which were found to be in good agreement with reported literature values. (11.68 g, 78%)
