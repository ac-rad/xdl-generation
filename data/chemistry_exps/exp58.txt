To a solution of the furanone (1.1 g, 11 mmol) in carbon tetrachloride (30 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (2.0 g, 11 mmol) and the mixture heated to reflux. AIBN (50 mg) was added and the yellow solution was maintained at reflux for 30 minutes. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo and excess succinimide was removed by the addition of ether (30 ml) and filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting yellow oil was dissolved in triethyl phosphite (1.8 g, 11 mmol) and the mixture heated to 150 Â°C for 30 minutes. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (10-30 % Methanol / Ether) to yield the pure phosphonate as a clear oil (1.7 g, 7.2 mmol, 65 %).
