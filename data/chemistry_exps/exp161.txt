A solution of 3,4-Dimethyl-1-pent-4-enyl-pyrrole-2,5-dione (0.250g, 1.3mmol) in Acetonitrile (125ml) was degassed with Nitrogen for 15 min, then irradiated in a pyrex vessel using a mediuim pressure mercury lamp for 2.5h.  The solvent was removed, then the crude product was purified by column chromatography (100% EtOAc) to leave a white crystalline solid (247mg, 99%).
