To a solution of di-(Ac-Phe-(e-keto)aminopimelate(OLi)-OLi) pentahydrate (61.4mg, 141umol) in HPLC grade CH3OH (2mL) was added hydrazine hydrate (70uL, 72.1mg, 1.44mmol). The solution was acidified to pH 5.0 by the careful addition of CF3CO2H and after 30min NaCNBH3 (89.4mg, 1.42mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred at RT overnight, then acidified by the addition of conc. aq. HCl. Solvent was removed in vacuo and the solid residue dissolved in deionised water (1mL). The solution was applied to the H+ form of a column of Dowex AG50 WX-8 cation exchange resin (2mL bed volume) and eluted with deionised water until the washings were neutral. The desired product was eluted with 1N NH3 in deionised water. Removal of solvent afforded the product as a glassy semi-solid (52.1mg, 132.2umol, 93.8%).
