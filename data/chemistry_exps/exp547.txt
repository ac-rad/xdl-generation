A mixture of 3-oxo-N-[4-[4-(3-oxobutanoylamino)phenyl]ethylphenyl]butanamide (300 mg, 0.789 mmol), urea (140 mg, 2.37 mmol), 5-bromovanilin (460 mg, 1.97 mmol) and catalytic amount of conc. HCl (4 drops) in EtOH (10 mL) was heated at reflux for 1 day. After the completion of reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool. The solid product formed was filtered, washed with water (5 mL) and cold ether (3x5 mL) and dried. The title compound was obtained as a brown solid (640 mg, 81% yield).
