Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (18.3 g, 0.11 mol) and thionyl chloride (19 ml) were dissolved in dioxane (50 ml) and heated to reflux for 3 h at 105°C. The solvent and excess thionyl chloride were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was distilled under vacuum (180-190°C, 4x10-3 mbar). Yield 15.9 g (71%).
