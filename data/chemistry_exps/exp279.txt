2,6-Dimethylanisole (4.08 g, 30 mmol) was dissolved in CCl4 (250 ml) along with benzoyl peroxide (10 mg).  N-Bromosuccinimide (21.36 g, 120 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated at reflux for 6 hours while being irradiated with a 250 W light-bulb.  The reaction was allowed to cool and was then filtered to give a yellow solution.  This solution was reduced in vacuo to give 2,6-bis(dibromomethyl)anisole as a pale yellow solid (13.42g, 99%).  A sample was recrystallised from hexane for characterisation.
