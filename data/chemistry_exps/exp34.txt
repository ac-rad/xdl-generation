To trimethylsilyl acetylene (2 g, 20 mmol, 1 equiv.) in THF (14 mL) at 0 °C was added n-butyl lithium (8.3 mL of a 2.44 M solution in hexanes, 20 mmol, 1 equiv.) dropwise.  The reaction mixture was stirred for 25 minutes at 0 °C where a solution of tributyltin chloride (6.6 g, 22 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) in THF (2 mL) was added and stirring was continued at ambient temperature for 16 hours.  The reaction mixture was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) and washed with water (10 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (10 mL).  The organics were collected and dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvents removed in vacuo.  Purification of the oil was achieved via distillation at reduced pressure to yield a clear colourless oil (4.88 g, 63%)
