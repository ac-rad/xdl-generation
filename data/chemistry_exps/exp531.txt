0.58g (4 mmol) of 2-naphthol, 0.41g (4 mmol) of sodium bromide and 1.225g (2 mmol) of oxone were placed in a mortar and pestle. The reagents were ground together ca. 1-2 minutes until they became a fine powder, then transferred into a plastic reagent bottle with grinding media. (See Notes) The bottle was placed inside a rock tumbler container and tumbled for five hours or overnight. Dichloromethane (ca. 10 mL, see Notes) was added to the container, the container was sealed and vigorously shaken by hand, and the liquid was gravity filtered into a 100 mL round bottom flask through a fluted paper. The dichloromethane wash was repeated a total of 3 times, and the resulting dark brown-red solution was reduced to a solid by rotary evaporation. The resulting crude 1-bromo-2-naphthol is a dark brown solid showing flecks of iridescent color, approximately 0.7g. (See Notes)This product was crystallized from boiling n-heptane by transferring the solid to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and adding ca. 10 mL of heptane, then heating to boiling using a heat gun. The hot solution was separated from the dark oily residue by decanting into a beaker pre-cooled in an ice bath, and the resulting clusters of beige, needlelike crystals were collected in a BÃ¼chner funnel and washed with ice-cold n-heptane, yielding 0.383 g (1.72 mmol) of 1-bromo-2-naphthol, 43% yield.
