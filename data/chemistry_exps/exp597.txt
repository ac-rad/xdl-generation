Step 1 <br/>Preparation of 6-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(4-triisopropylsilyloxybenzoyl)-3,4-dihydro-naphthalene <br/>To a solution of 5.9 g (15.28 mmol) of 6-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalene (prepared as described in Jones, et al., J. Med. Chem., 35: 931-938 (1992) in 200 mL of dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere was added 1.87 g (15.28 mmol) of dimethylamino-pyridine and 4.1 mL (15.28 mmol) of triisopropyl trifluoromethane-sulfonate ("TIPS triflate," Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.). <br/>The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours, after which time the reaction was quenched by addition of aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. <br/>The resulting mixture was extracted twice with dichloromethane. <br/>The organic layers were combined, extracted with brine solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to yield 8.05 g (97percent) of the title compound as a thick yellow oil. <br/>
