1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate (57.5 g, 258 mmol) was diluted with deionized water (5 ml) in an open-topped three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with dropping funnel and thermometer. Sulphuric acid (2 drops) was added. The solution was heated at 175 °C for 3 h with vigorous stirring, allowing water and generated methanol to boil off. Deionized water was dispensed dropwise from the dropping funnel, in order to maintain the temperature of 175 °C. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, deionized water (50 ml) and activated charcoal were added, and the slurry was stirred at 50 °C overnight. The slurry was filtered through silica gel, and the water was removed by rotary evaporation. The product was dried under high vacuum to yield 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (53.0 g, 98%) as a colourless highly-viscous liquid.
