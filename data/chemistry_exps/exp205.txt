An oven-dried Schlenk tube was charged with an aryl bromide (1.0mmol), an amine (1.2mmol, 1.2eq.), Pd2(dba)3 (0.01mmol, 0.02eq. Pd), 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-imidazolinium chloride (SIPr.HCl) (0.04mmol, 0.04eq.) and a magnetic stirrer bar and then sealed with a septum. The tube was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times, after which LHMDS (1M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 1.5mL, 1.5eq) was added. The tap was closed and the tube placed in an oil bath maintained at 22Â°C, followed by stirring for between 10-72 hours (reaction times were not optimised). After all the starting material had been consumed, as judged by TLC, the mixture was diluted with ether and filtered through a sinter. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude material purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel) with an eluent of ethyl acetate/hexane.
