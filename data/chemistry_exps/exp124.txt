Benzoyl peroxide (0.35 g) was added to a mixture of cyclohexene (35 g; 0.43 mol) and N-bromosuccinimide (24.9 g; 0.14 mol) in carbon tetrachloride (100 cm3). The mixture was stirred for 2 hours, then heated slowly to reflux, and maintained at reflux for 3.5 hours. The mixture was cooled, filtered and concentrated, then distilled at reduced pressure (b.p. 61 Â°C @ 12 mmHg) to give 3-bromocyclohexene as a colourless oil (15.71 g; 70%).
