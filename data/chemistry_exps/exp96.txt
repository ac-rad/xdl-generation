Toluene (80 ml) was added to a mixture of [Li(NMe2)] (3.7 g, 0.068 mol) and ZrCl4 (4.0 g, 0.017 mol) at room temperature. After stirring overnight, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the yellow residue was sublimed at 80Â°C and    10-3 mbar giving an off-white crystalline solid. Yield = 83%, 3.7g.
