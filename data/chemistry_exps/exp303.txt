A mixture of 2-(2,3,5-trimethoxy-4-methyl-benzoyl)-benzoic acid (15 g, 45.5 mmol) and concentrated sulfuric acid (100 cm3) was magnetically stirred on an oil bath at 50-52 ºC for 6 h. After standing overnight the dark red solution was poured on to ice and the deep orange-brown precipitate filtered and washed with water. After drying 11 g (83%) of partially demethylated product was obtained. The partially demethylated product (3.5 g) was heated with magnetic stirring under reflux with dimethyl sulfate (9 cm3), K2CO3 (12 g) and 2-butanone (50 cm3) for 6 h. The suspension was filtered and the residue washed with 2-butanone (2 x 20 cm3). Evaporation of the filtrate gave 1,2,4-trimethoxy-3-methyl-anthraquinone as yellow brown needles (3.5 g), mp. 122.2 ºC.
