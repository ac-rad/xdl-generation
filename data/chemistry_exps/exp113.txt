To a cold (0 ÂºC) solution of the silyl ether (460 mg, 1.16 mmol, 1 equiv.) in dry tetrahydrofuran (11.6 mL), was added tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (1.3 mL of a 1 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 1.27 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and the resulting solution stirred for 45 minutes allowing the mixture to warm to room temperature. The resulting solution was diluted with dichloromethane (20 mL) and quenched with water (5 mL). The organic layer was extracted with brine (5 mL) and dried over magnesium sulfate, followed by solvent reduction in vacuo. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 5 : 1 to 3 : 1) to give the alcohol as a white powder (106 mg, 32 %).
