3,4,5,6-Tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (0.5 g, 3.29 mmol) and ammonium acetate (0.253 g, 3.29 mmol) were mixed in a beaker (100 mL). The mixture was placed in a domestic microwave oven and irradiated at 600 W power for 1 min, after which the solids had melted to a clear liquid and gas evolution was observed. Irradiation was continued for an additional 30 seconds and then the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature and the product was leached from the solid reaction mass with acetone (10 mL). Evaporation of the acetone and purification by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petrol 1:3) gave the title product as pale yellow crystals. Yield (398 mg, 80%).
