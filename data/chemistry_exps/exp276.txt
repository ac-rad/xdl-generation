Benzyl bromide (2.0 ml, 16.84 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in DMSO (40 ml). Sodium azide (1.64 g, 25.26 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was added as a solid and the reaction was stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Water (75 ml) was added slowly (exothermic) before extracting the product into diethyl ether (3 × 150 ml). The combined diethyl ether layers were washed with brine (2 × 150 ml), dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent removed to leave a clear oil. Yield = 1.63 g, 12.24 mmol, 73%.
