96 mL of dry, degassed DMF was stirred under argon in an oven-dried, 500 mL round-bottomed schlenk. The solution was cooled in an ice-water bath as CS2 (48 mL, 0.80 mol) was added via cannula. Small pieces of sodium (2.9 g, 0.13 mol) were added over a period of 20 minutes, resulting in a colour change to deep red. The reaction solution was left to stir in the ice-water bath for 6.5 hours until all of the solid sodium had been consumed and there was no further change to the colour of the solution. The reaction solution was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and ZnCl2 (4.26 g, 0.03 mol) in 72 mL of ammonia solution (35%) and 20 mL of water was added. NnBu4Br (20.15 g, 0.06 mol) in 100 mL of water was added portion-wise over 30 minutes as the red solution slowly darkened to purple and a precipitate formed. The suspension was stirred overnight and then filtered to yield a red-purple microcrystalline solid which was washed with copious amounts of isopropanol and diethyl ether and then dried under vacuum, 28.6 g, 97%.
