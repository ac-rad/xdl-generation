A solution of the carbohydrate (3,4-di-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-D-2,3-galactal) (5.10 g, 23.83 mmol, 1 equiv.) in acetonitrile (128 mL), cooled to -25 ºC, was added dropwise to a mixture of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) (39.2 g, 71.50 mmol, 3 equiv.) and sodium azide (2.32 g, 35.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) also kept at -25 ºC (under nitrogen).  The resulting yellow suspension was allowed to stir for 8 hours at -15 °C until starting material could no longer be detected by thin layer chromatography.  To the orange suspension was added diethyl ether (130 mL) at -15 °C resulting in a yellow suspension, followed by water (65 mL) to give a yellow solution.  Extraction of the organic layer with cold water (2 x 65 mL) and cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 65 mL), followed by drying over sodium sulfate and concentration in vacuo gave the crude product.  This was purified by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 5 : 1 to 0 : 1) to give a mixture of alpha, beta and talo-isomers of the desired compound (4.25 g, 56 %, alpha : beta : talo - 59 : 33 : 8).  Also isolated was N-acetyl-3,4-di-O-acetyl-2-azido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosylamine (0.74 g, 10 %).
