Synthesis of sodium dimethylmalonate:  A THF (10  mL) slurry of NaH (654 mg, 27 mmol) was added dropwise to a cooled  (0 °C) solution of dimethylmalonate (3.00 g, 23 mmol) in THF (20 mL) under an inert atmosphere.  The mixture was warmed to ambient temperature with stirring over 1 h under an oil bubbler presure of argon to allow venting of the H2 under an inert atmosphere.  The mixture was then filtered through Celite on a frit into a Schlenk tube.  The solvent was removed in vacuo to yield a sticky white solid.  The solid was dried by heating at 50 °C under vacuum (1x10-2 mbar) for 6 h (3.07 g, 88% yield).  A 1H nmr spectrum of the dried solid showed no THF to be present.  Synthesis of bis(1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene)palladium(0):  1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene (792 mg, 2.03 mmol), bis(methallyl)di-chloro-dipalladium(II) (200 mg, 0.508 mmol) and sodium dimethylmalonate (157 mg, 1.02 mmol) were placed in an ampoule with a teflon stopcock in a glove box.  The ampoule was sealed and removed from the glove box.  The ampoule was attached to a double manifold Schlenk line and fitted with a septum.  THF (40 mL) was added via canula and the ampoule sealed.  The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 16 h with stirring after which the solution was bright orange.  The solvent was removed in vacuo and the product extracted with toluene (3 x 20 mL).  The extracts were combined and filtered through Celite on a frit.   The toluene solution was concentrated and cooled to –50 °C to yield an orange crystalline solid.  The filtrate was removed via cannula and the product washed with cold toluene (3 x 5 mL).   The solid was dried under vacuum (1x10-2 mbar) to yield the product as an orange crystalline solid (567 mg, 63 % yield).
