The acetonide (12.51g, 49.6mmol) is stirred in methanol (43mL) at room temperature and the HCl (4.3mL) is added.  The reaction is stirred until completion (TLC, 7-8 hours) then carefully quenched with sodium bicarbonate solution, extracted 6 times with ether, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated in vacuum to give an off white solid.  Purification can be by column chromatography eluting with 35-100% EtOAc/PE or more conveniently by recrystallisation using 1:1 EtOAc/PE to yield about 10g (90-95%) of white solid.
