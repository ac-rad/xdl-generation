But-3-yn-1-ol (1mL, 13.2mmol) is stirred in DCM (12mL) at 0°C and p-toluene sulphonyl chloride (3.8g, 20mmol)) is added, followed by pyridine (2.2mL, 28.4mmol).  The reaction is stirred at 0°C until completion (TLC, about 3 hours) then diluted with ether (35mL) and washed consecutively with water, 1M HCl, NaHCO3 (sat. soln.) and brine, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.  Purification is by column chromatography eluting with 15%EtOAc/PE, and yields are quantitative.
