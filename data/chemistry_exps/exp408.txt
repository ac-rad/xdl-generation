To a clean 2 Lt 3 necked flask carrying thermometer pocket and a mechanical stirrer, was charged Longifolene (1.01 kg, 5 mol) followed by montmorillonite K10 clay (200 g, 20% by weight). The reaction mixture was heated to about 110-115°C and maintained at this temperature for 17 h (at this point of time, 13C NMR of the reaction mixture clearly shows the absence of 2 peaks for the olefin carbon at δ 167.36 and 99.34. You will see new peaks at δ 154.87 and 110.52 for Isolongifolene).The reaction mixture was cooled to about 50 °C and diluted with toluene (1000 mL) and filtered. The clay was further washed with toluene (200 mL). The combined organic layer thus obtained was concentrated to get about 1.1 g residue. This residue was distilled under vacuum (113-114 /7 torr) to get 900 g of pale yellow Isolongifolene (Yield: 89%).
