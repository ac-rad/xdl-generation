Into a boiling tube (A) was placed either 1,4-naphthoquinone (0.91 g, 5.8 mmol) and ethanol (10 mL) and the tube was heated in a water bath until the entire solid dissolved. Into a second boiling tube (B) was added sodium carbonate (0.2 g), distilled water (5 mL) and cold 30% hydrogen peroxide (2 mL). Boiling tube A was placed under a cold tap until very slight crystallization occurred, then boiling tube B was added to A in one go. With swirling, boiling tube A was cooled in ice water which produced a white solid. The solid was isolated at the pump and washed with water (3 × 10 ml).  The solid was dried at the pump to yield 2,3-epoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (0.39 g, 39%) as white crystals.
