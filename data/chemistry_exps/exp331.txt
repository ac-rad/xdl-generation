In a two-necked 125 mL round flask equipped with an addition funnel and a reflux condenser fitted with a bubbler, the dry isopropyl alcohol (0.70 mmol) was added. Through the addition funnel, freshly distilled PCl3 (0.23 mmol) was added dropwise with magnetic stirring so the temperature was kept around 0Â°C. After all the chloride was added, the mixture was kept under stirring at reflux for 2 h. The mixture was then kept under vacuum to remove residual HCl and finally the diisopropyl phosphonate was obtained a colorless liquid (36.6 g, 94%).
