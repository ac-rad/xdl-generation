A mixture of hydroquinone (55 g, 0.5 mol), 1-bromopropane (24.6 g, 0.2 mol) was heated under N2 to reflux. A solution of KOH (11.2 g, 0.2 mol) in ethanol (80 cm3) was added over 20 m and heating continued for 4 h. After neutralisation (acetic acid, 20 cm3), evaporation gave a white solid which was extracted  with chloroform (4 x 50 cm3). The chloroform was evaporated to give an oil containing white crystals (hydroquinone) which was dissolved in petroleum ether (60/80), filtering hot. After cooling, filtration gave white plates (9.72 g, 32%), m.p. 48-50 ºC.
