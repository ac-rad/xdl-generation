In a three-necked round bottomed flask fitted with an argon inlet, a thermometer and an addition funnel, are successively placed N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (24.00 g), dichloromethane (270 mL) and succinyl chloride (12.9 mL). The resulting suspension is cooled to 0°C under argon and triethylamine (67 mL) is added dropwise at such a rate that internal temperature remains below 10°C. When addition is completed, reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for two hours. The solution is then allowed to warm to room temperature and then poured onto saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (150 mL). The obtained slurry is filtered on a glass sintered funnel and the layers are separated. Aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2×75 mL). Organic layers are combined, washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated. The compound is obtained as a light brown solid (15.31 g; 64%)
