To a solution of 2-acetylpyridine (4.84 g, 40 mmol, 2 equiv.) in ethanol (100 ml), are added thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (2.24 g, 20 mmol, 1 equiv.), potassium hydroxide (3.08 g, 55 mmol, 2.75 equiv.) and ammonia solution (58 ml). The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. The resulting pale yellow precipitate is filtered off and successively washed with water (4Ã—25 ml) and cold 50% ethanol (25 ml). The yellow product is first air dried for 48 hours and then in a dessicator over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield is 2.40 g (38 %).
