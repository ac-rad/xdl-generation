A Schelnk vessel was charged with dry THF (30 ml), diisopropylamine (1.18 ml,8.4 mmol) and the solution was cooled to -78˚C, at which point n-butyllithium (2.8ml, 2.5 M, 7.0 mmol) was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min before being warmed to 0˚C for a further 10 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled again to -78˚C and a solution of 5-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine (1.0 g, 5.9mmol) in dry THF was added dropwise. The resulting maroon solution wasstirred for a 1 h at -78˚C. Chlorotrimethylsilane (0.9 ml, 7.1 mmol) was then added rapidly to the solution and after 1 min the reaction was quenched by the rapid addition of absolute ethanol. The resulting pale yellow/green solution was allowed to warm up to room temperature before a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (150 ml), was added and the reaction mixture extracted into DCM (3 x 75ml). The organic fractions were combined, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and solvents removed under reduced pressure to yield the titular product as a white solid that was used without purification.
