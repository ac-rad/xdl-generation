To a solution of compound   7 (384mg, 884μmol) in   ethanol (8mL) was added   hydrazine monohydrate (130μL, 2.68mmol), and the mixture was refluxed for 1h. After the precipitate was removed, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CHCl<sub>3</sub>/MeOH, 30:1) to afford amine   8 (200mg, 656μmol) in 74percent yield. Compound 8: colorless oil; <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CDCI<sub>3</sub>) δ 1.06 (9H, s), 7.37 (4H, m), 7.43 (2H, m), 7.67 (4H, m); <sup>13</sup>C NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) δ 19.1, 26.9 (3C) 127.7 (4C), 129.7 (2C), 135.5 (4C); <sup>2</sup>H NMR (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) δ 2.79, 3.66; <sup>15</sup>N NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) δ 31.1; GCFDMS m/z 305.2 (M+H)<sup>+</sup>; HRGCFDMS m/z 305.20385 (M+H)<sup>+</sup>, calcd for C<sub>18</sub>
