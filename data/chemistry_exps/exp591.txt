SEMTo a solutionof tert-butyl-4-oxo-1-(1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)-1,3, 8- triazaspiro[4.5]decane-8-carboxylate(200 mg, 0.40 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml)was added sodium hydride (48 mg, 1.2 mol) at 0Â°C After stirringfor 15 minutes, iodomethane (283 mg, 2.0 mmol)was added. After stirringfor 1 hour, the reactionwas quenched by addition of ice-water (10 ml). The15  mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate(3 x 20 ml). The combinedorganic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silicagel column chromatography eluting with dichloromethane : methanol = 100:1 to afford tert-butyl-3-methyl-4-oxo-1-(1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl}-1, 3, 8-triazaspiro[4.5]decane-8-carboxylate as a white solid (180 mg, 87percent).20  LCMS (ESI): m/z = 516.2 [M+Ht.1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCI3)i3 = 0.01-0.03 (m, 9H), 0.86-0.95(m, 2H), 1.44 (s, 9H), 1.69-1 74 (m, 2H),Â 2.12-2.16 (m, 2H), 2.99 (s, 3H), 3.57-3.62(m, 4H), 3.82-3.94(m, 2H), 4.68 (s, 2H), 5.27-5.66 (m, 2H),Â 7.00-7.08 (m, 2H), 7.61-7.64 (m, 1H), 7.88-7.98 (m, 1H).
