A mixture of 2-bromobenzoic acid (10.63 g, 52.9 mmol), 4-methoxythiophenol (6.57 g, 52.9 mmol), K2CO3 (14.60 g, 105.8 mmol) and powdered Cu bronze (1.71 g, 26.44 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) was stirred at reflux for 6 hours. Upon cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into ice (500 g) and acidified with concentrated HCl to pH=4 giving a white solid.Â  The solid was isolated and dried at the vacuum pump** to yield 2-((4-methoxyphenyl)thio)benzoic acid (6.10 g, 44%) as a white solid.
