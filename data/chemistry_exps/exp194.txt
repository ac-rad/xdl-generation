A one-liter, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and condenser was charged with acetone (500 mL), potassium phthalimide (92.5 g, 0.5 moles) and 1,4- dibromopentane (153 g, 0.665 moles). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 24 hours (HPLC showed 2.5% unreacted phthalimide), then cooled to 15 °C. After filtering off the precipitated potassium bromide, the cake was washed with the acetone (50 mL). The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator to give 187.0 g of viscous yellow oil. Excess 1,4-dibromopentane (34.5 g) was distilled off at 35-40 °C/0.3 mmHg of pressure, leaving 144 g (97 %) of a yellow viscous oil, purity by HPLC = 92.3 area%. TLC (Merck, silica gel 60 F254 on glass 5X10 cm eluted with toluene /1% methanol) showed essentially one spot.
