To a well-stirred mixture of cyanoacetic acid (80 mmol) in tert butyl methyl ether (TBME, 50 mL) at about 10­ºC was added sulfuric acid (18 g, 10 mL) in 10 min time. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 10–12 h. The reaction mixture was added to 20% sodium carbonate solution (100 mL). The reaction mass was extracted in TBME or dichloromethane (50 mL × 2). The combined organic layer was washed with water (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the product (94–98%). Most examples gave NMR pure product. This can be scaled up to 1 kg batches.
