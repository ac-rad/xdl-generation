To a solution of the aldehyde (80 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1 equiv.) in benzene (4 mL) were added (TMS)3SiH (117 Î¼L, 0.38 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) and AIBN (4 mg, 0.02 mmol, 0.08 equiv.). The solution was sparged by bubbling argon through the solution for 30 minutes after which the solution was maintained under an atmosphere of argon and heated at reflux for 4 hours. After cooling and removal of the solvent in vacuo the remaining residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, EtOAc-hexane, 1:20) to yield the cyclopentane (134 mg, 94%) as a mixture of four diastereoisomers. Integration of the methyl ether (OMe) signals between 3.2-3.4 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum established the diastereoisomeric ratio to be 35:25:20:20.
