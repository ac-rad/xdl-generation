To a 100 mL flask equipped a large stir bar was added the 3-chloro-1-propanol (4.73 g, 0.050 mol) and acetone (50 mL, 1 M in the alcohol). Sodium iodide (37.47 g, 0.250 mol) was then added all at once to the flask . The flask was then equipped with a reflux condenser and, after placing the reaction under a nitrogen atmosphere, was heated to reflux. The mixture was allowed to react for 24 hours. After this time, the now yellow solution was filtered through a medium porosity fritted funnel, eluting with ≈200 mL of acetone into a 500 mL round-bottom flask.1 The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to afford a dry orange solid. This solid was triturated with a 1:1 v./v. hexanes to Et2O solution  (2 X 200mL) and the grey fine precipitate was removed by filtration through a medium porosity fritted funnel.2  The slightly clouded3 yellow-tinged filtrate was washed with ≈100 mL of a 10% w./w. sodium thiosulfate solution, causing the organic layer to become colorless. The organic layer was then washed with ≈100 mL of deionized water, followed by ≈100 mL of brine, and dried with sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to afford pure 3-iodo-1-propanol as a pale yellow oil (7.78 g, 84%).
