A thick walled 200 ml ampoule charged with neopentyl chloride (5 g, 5.8 ml, 47 mmol) was degassed and back-filled by cycling on a schlenk line 3 times. Pentane (60 ml) was then added via cannula. To the resulting solution was then added lithium wire (2 g, excess), the vessel was evacuated and refluxed (at 50°C) for 10 days in vacuo. After cooling, the cloudy purple solution was filtered and the resulting clear yellow solution was concentrated in vacuo. Standing overnight at -30°C afforded colourless crystals. The reaction residual was then washed with a further amount of pentane (60 ml) and crystallised in a similar fashion to the initial crop. Total yield = 2.6 g, 71 %.
