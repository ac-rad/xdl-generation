In separate vessel add 2eq of DIPEA (2.17mL) to EDC (3.575g, 18.65mmol, 3eq) in about 5 mL DMF to give slurry.  Add slurry in portions to the phenol solution, it will dissolve as it reacts.  Sonicate for about 10 min more for complete dissolution and to allow for active ester/anhydride formation. Meanwhile pre-swell the resin (8.0g, 1 eq, 0.777mmol/g, 6.216 mmol) in minimum volume of DCM and then add the coupling solution and shake overnight adding more DCM if required to give good mixing, but keeping overall concentration as high as possible. Wash resin with DMF, DCM, diethyl ether and THF 3 x 40mL each with mixing.  Ninhydrin spot test seems to be the most sensitive way of checking for the complete consumption of amine.   Just add a few drops of commercially available 2% ninhydrin solution (HIGHLY TOXIC!) in n-butanol to a few beads of resin in a glass vial and heat carefully in a fume hood using a heat gun.  Positive test is purple after a couple of mins.  Perform an analogous test on a control resin which should give a negative result (eg chloromethyl).     If free amine is still detected, repeat the coupling procedure as above, using 2/3 the amount of each reagent.   2.  Cleavage of tetrafluorophenol-tetrafluorobenzoic acid esters: These esters will form due to the phenol coupling to itself.  Destroying them is easily performed by suspending the resin in 20% piperidine/DMF for 1h with mixing.  Wash resin thoroughly as piperidine sticks to resin.  Use DMF, THF, Et2O and DCM as before.                     3. Quenching of phenoxide-piperidine salt with HCl: Cleavage of the esters in the previous step leaves behind the piperidine salt and it's important to remove this for accurate loading analysis and to prevent piperidine interference in later reactions.  For 6.216mmol of resin, add 6.216mL of 2.0M HCl(aq) in approx 60mL DMF (make up the HCl/DMF solution first) and shake for 2h. Wash well with DCM, DMF, THF, ether and dry in vacuo.  Maximum loading in this case would be 0.6761mmol/g.  Yield typically: 90-100% after 2 couplings as described above.  Assessed as described below.  4. Loading analysis: To 100mg of resin (dry and accurately weighed out), add about 2mL DCM and 10 eq DIPEA then 10eq acetic anhydride, shake overnight.  Wash well with DCM, THF, Ether.  Cleave with amine of choice, eg 4-methylbenzylamine, 3 eq in DCM, 2mL overnight. Wash resin through onto a silica plug to remove excess amine and vac down to give pure amide product.  Assess yield based on the mass of product gained.  Typically 90-100%.",

    "text": " Note:  The weights shown below are the maximum allowed for this step in our laboratory as the diazotisation is difficult to control.  It is essential that the temperature is maintained below 0\u00b0C while adding NaNO2 to H2SO4.\r\nThe nitro aniline (175 g, 1.15 mol) was dissolved in hot glacial acetic acid (1.45 L) in a 5 L, three-neck round-bottom flask, fitted with an overhead stirrer.  This was cooled to 15\u00b0C in an acetone/dry ice bath (plastic washing up basin).  Meanwhile sodium nitrite (115.7 g, 1.68 mol) was slowly added to conc. H2SO4 (600 ml) which was kept almost freezing in an acetone / dry ice bath, making sure that no NO2 evolved (brown colour).  The solution had a paste-like consistency and a greyish colour. (In the past we heated the solution gently. We have recently found this to be unnecessary but I include the details in case it is required in some cases.  The heat source was removed as the temperature reached about 40\u00b0C as the temperature will rise to about 80\u00b0C very rapidly.  The mixture was quickly placed in a cold bath to prevent NO2 being evolved).  Overall, this procedure was more safely performed by two people, one adding portions of NaNO2 and the other stirring the solution rapidly with a glass rod.  This prevented local heating and formation of NaNO2.  While maintaining the nitroaniline solution below 25\u00b0C (very important) the NaNO2 / H2SO4 solution was added drop-wise.  The solution was too viscous to add via a dropping funnel so it was poured into the open vessel.  During this process the unreacted nitroaniline formed a solid block on the surface of the glass.  This was mechanically broken up using a long spatula.  This allowed it to react to completion.  The solution was stirred for a further 90 min.  The solution was then poured into a plastic bucket (10-20 L) containing 3 L water.  Urea 115.5 g, 1.92 mol) was added portion-wise to prevent too much heating. Gas evolved ar this stage, presumably CO2.  A potassium iodide solution (279 g, 1.68 mol) in 1 L water was added. (This must be added as a solution.   At this stage more gas is evolved, presumably N2 is evolved so a fume hood should be on maximum.  Sodium hydrogen sulphite (102 g, 1.15 mol) was added in portions to remove excess iodine.  Again some heating occurred.  A yellow precipitate formed.  This was filtered on a buchner funnel and washed with water until no yellow colour persisted in the washings.  The crude iodotoluene was then dissolved in 500 ml DCM and the residual water separated.  Further washing is optional.  The DCM solution was dried over MgSO4 and the solvent removed.  Crude yield 85-95%.  TLC in hexane:ethyl acetate (2:1) showed the purity.  If necessary the product can be recrystallised from methanol. \r\n\r\n",

Heat the mixture slowly to about 60\u00b0C with gentle stirring. At about that temperature a fairly vigorous exotherm usually occurs, hence the use of an efficient condenser (see comments). Keep below 100\u00b0C and cool if necessary. After the exotherm subsides, heat the suspension to reflux (158-160\u00b0C) for 6 h.

(It's not essential to have a solution, a suspension is more likely at this temp). Iodobenzene diacetate (9.60 g) was added to the stirred mixture and the resulting yellow coloured solution was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 h. The reaction mixture was poured into a large excess of iced water and stirred for 1 h. A yellow coloured solid precipitated on standing overnight. (It's important to allow the solid to stand as the particle size appears to increase giving higher yield on filtration). The light yellow solid was isolated by filtration and dried with a flow of air through through the buchner funnel. Several portions of ether, in which the product is insoluble were used to wash away any iodobenzene present. The yellow solid was dissolved in a minimum of boiling methanol. (It is important to keep this volume low in order to achieve a higher yield, 50-100 ml MeOH). The solution was placed in a freezer overnight whereupon an off-white solid was recovered via filtration. Yield = 6.70-7.80 g, 60-70%.",

Add the Grignard reagent solution via a cannula with vigorous stirring. After addition allow the resulting solution to warm to room temperature. Remove approximately 500 mL of solvent under reduced pressure. Fit a reflux condenser and heat the solution to (almost) 100 \u00baC on a boiling water bath for one hour. During this time glassy solids will precipitate from solution. Remove all volatiles under vacuum until a dry brown cake is obtained (colourless crystals of B(C6F5)3 may already be apparent). The product is isolated by extracting this cake with warm (45 \u00baC) hexanes (600 mL). As the hexane solution cools very fine feathery crystals will form. Cooling to -30 \u00baC will cause further crystallisation. The very fine nature of B(C6F5)3 crystals obtained in this fashion makes them difficult to separate by filtration from the mother liquor. One solution is to add 30 mL of diethyl ether to the collection flask before filtration, now instead of obtaining feathery crystals of B(C6F5)3, cubic crystals of (Et2O)B(C6F5)3 form, which can be easily separated by filtration. The yield depends upon the effort invested in the extraction process. We will typically extract the magnesium halides three times. For subsequent extractions we use the mother liquor obtained after crystallisation of the previous fraction. The best isolated yield obtained using this method was 70% Pure B(C6F5)3 can be obtained from (Et2O)B(C6F5)3 or the crude product described above by sublimation (<0.1 mmHg, 100 \u00baC).",

The solution was cooled to -40\u00b0C in an acetone /dry ice bath with stirring and dimethylamine gas bubbled through the solution such that the internal reaction temperature was maintained between -29\u00b0C and -26\u00b0C. A white solid precipitated immediately. After around 1 h of cautious gas addition (regulating flow and sometimes switching off altogether) it was found that gas addition no longer led to an exotherm and no additional precipitation was detected. The system was allowed to warm to ambient temperature with gentle stirring under argon. The white precipitate was left to settle for some time and then isolated by cannula filtration, washed with pentane (2 x 50 ml), filtered again and dried in vacuo. Yield 12.08g (95 %)",

The vessel was placed under an atmosphere of argon or dinitrogen via three pump/refill cycles. The acetic acid and water mixture was then slowly added to the Iron powder via cannula using Schlenk technique while allowing evolved H2 gas to escape (a needle in the septum was used for this purpose). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for a further 1 h. The reaction mixture was then heated and stirred at reflux (115 \u00b0C) for 8 h under N2 before cooling to RT. The reaction mixture changed from clear with a grey solid to a dark grey/brown solution.

Then 50 ml of a solution of 115 g (1.5 moles) redistilled allyl chloride in 500 ml of dry ether was added in one portion and the mixture stirred vigorously. After five minutes, the reaction commenced as evidenced by formation of a white solution and vigorous ether reflux. The remainder of the solution was then added drop wise over six hours. Midway through the addition, 50 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran was added to redissolve the white precipitated Grignard complex.\nAfter completion of the chloride addition, the solution was stirred for one hour, then a solution of 28 g ( 0.5 mole) redistilled propargyl alcohol in 200 ml ether was added, dropwise, over a period of three hours. A vigorous reaction occurred resulting in considerable ether evaporation. At the end of the addition, 300 ml additional ether was added and the solution was then stirred for fifteen hours. The mixture was decomposed by pouring over a slurry of 100 g ammonium chloride in ~ 500 g ice with manual stirring in a two liter beaker, and the two clear layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with 2x 200 ml ether portions.The combined ether layers were washed twice with 100 ml portions of water and dried over 10 g anhydrous magnesium sullfate for one hour in a 1 liter Erlenmeyer flask. The ether solution was decanted into a 1 liter beaker and the ether was removed, on a steam bath in a fume hood, yielding a light yellow liquid. Fractionation was accomplished in a 50 ml conical vial immersed in an oil heating bath maitained at ~ 100\u00b0 , with a short distilling column and water aspirator pressure. Two fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography (5 ft x 0.25 inch Triton-X 305 column). The first fraction, b.p.75-80\u00b0, (30mm) weighed 16g, and contained 13.9 g 2-methylene-4-pentene-1-ol and an unidentified high boiling biproduct. The second fraction, b.p. 80-90 \u00b0, weighed 6.54 g and contained 3.18 g 2-methylene-4-penten-1-ol and 3.12 g biproduct. The fractions were combined and the components separated by preparative gas chromatography utilizing a 8 ft x 1 inch column packed with Triton X 305, yielding 17g (34.7% based on amount of propargyl alcohol), of pure 2-methylene-4-penten-1-ol. Other runs were typically in the 28-38% yield range.",

The outlet of the condenser led with tygon tubing to a two holed rubber adapter fitting a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask charged with 3.7 g ( 0.033 mole) sorbic acid in 100 ml anhydrous diethyl ether . The distilling flask was charged with 2.5 g of potassium hydroxide pellets, 4 ml deionized water and 13 ml 190 proof ethanol.. The addition funnel was charged with 12 g Diazald in 100 ml anhydrous diethyl ether. The distilling flask was warmed to ~ 65\u2070 C with a water bath and stirring was commenced. The Erlenmeyer flask containing the sorbic acid was cooled to ~ 0\u2070 C with an ice bath and equipped with a magnetic stirrer and hot plate-magnetic stirrer. Rubber Tygon tubing led from the Erlenmeyer flask to a second 100 ml rubber stoppered Erlenmeyer flask containing ~ 30 ml glacial acetic acid , in order to trap any traces of unreacted diazomethane. Stirring was commenced in the cooled Erlenmeyer flask containing the sorbic acid, while the ether solution of Diazald was added dropwise over 3 hours to the warmed distilling flask containing the potassium hydroxide. Water bath temperatures were maintained at 65-70\u2070 C during the addition. A yellow solution of diazomethane in ether distilled into the cooled Erlenmeyer flask and reacted with the sorbic acid. After complete addition of the Diazald solution an additional 20 ml anhydrous ether was added through the dropping funnel into the distilling flask and distilled into the cooled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask was disassembled and the ether/methyl sorbate solution shaken 4 times with 20 ml portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, then 6 times with 10 ml portions of deionized water.

The purging was stopped and the reaction placed under normal nitrogen flow, and the reaction was heated at 80\u00b0C for 5 h using a mineral oil bath with a thermometer.\nThe reaction mixture was poured into a 1 L separatory funnel along with ethyl acetate (100 mL)\u00a0and water (100mL)\u00a0and swirled thoroughly. The aqueous layer was removed and the remaining organic layer washed twice with water, once with 0.1M hydrochloric acid, once with 0.1M sodium hydroxide, and once with brine. The resulting organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and rotary evaporated to dryness, yielding a black solid.\nThe resulting solid was dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane and poured onto a glass fritted funnel under water-aspirator suction that has been loaded with a 1-2 inch plug of flash-chromatographic grade silica gel. (See Author\u2019s Comment) The crude product was eluted from the silica by pouring several portions of 20% dichloromethane in hexanes over the silica under vacuum, using an approximate total of 150-200 mL eluent. The solution in the filtering flask was rotary evaporated to dryness, giving a beige solid.
